- A firearm has a material rank that determines its durability.
- Bullets have a material rank that determines the damage dealt by the firearm that fires it.
- If a bullet of a higher material rank is discharged from a firearm of a lower material rank, there is a chance that the firearm misfires and is rendered inoperable.
- A firearm that discharges "real" bullets must do so via an activated Trained Weapon Technique whose rank is equal to or greater than the material rank of the bullet and the material rank of the bullet.
- All firearms may fire a "fake" rubber bullet that deal an unchanging 3d8. Rubber bullets can be fired using Freeform Techniques.
- The rank of a Trained Weapon Technique determines the range at which the bullet fired can reach.
