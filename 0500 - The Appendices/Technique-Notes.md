# Technique-Notes

## Transformation Techniques

Every character with a Transformation Quirk must have a corresponding technique that defines how they move between their active and inactive tranformation states. This technique does not count against your total numer of Technique Points but must be defined for the Transformation Quirk to be valid.

Activating a transformation technique costs a number of Limit Points equal to the Control Rank. Concentrating on the active transformation state costs the same amount of Limit Points every round. If a character is ever rendered incapacitated or Quirk Exhausts while in their active transformation state, then they immediate loose concentration on their active transformation state and revert to their inactive transformation state. If a character Quirk Exhausts, they cannot concentrate on their active transformation state again until they have replenished their Limit Pool to its maximum values.

## Buff Techniques

A Buff Technique is any technique that, when activated, enhances the Skill or Damage Output of a target, which could be oneself. The measure of the enhancement received is determined by the Rank of the technique.

The cost of activating a Buff Technique (or "Activation Cost") is determined by the appropriate table and rules. The cost of maintaining a Buff Technique (or "Maintenance Cost") is half the Activation Cost and is levied at the start of the turn of the character who activated the technique if they have chosen to maintain the effects. If the character chooses to dismiss the effects of the technique, then the Maintenence Cost is not levied. However, the character must pay the full Activation Cost the next time the Buff Technique is used.

Any statistic or mechanic could be influenced by a Buff Technique, at the Gamemaster's discretion. However, the benefits available to any Buff Technique are described in the series of tables provided in this document.



## Area of Effect Techniques

| Rank | Damage | Units Effected |
|------|--------|----------------|
| E    | 3      | 2              |
| D    | 3d4    | 3              |
| C    | 3d6    | 5              |
| B    | 3d8    | 9              |
| A    | 3d10   | 13             |
| S    | 3d12   | 20             |

### Medical Techniques

Separate from the mysterious flow of reviving energies that some Quirks manifest through Healing Techniques is the application of man-made healing solutions. This can range from over-the-counter medications and other readily-available first aid implements to full-range military-grade kits. Such implements carry with them a more reliable reputation for healing the wounded and sparing the dying but are nowhere near as immediately effective or potent as Quirk-based Healing Techniques. These limitations should be at the forefront of any hero's mind when developing such techniques.

Consumable medical kits are at the crux of any Medical Technique as they provide the Technique user the resources necessary to adminster healing or revival. Not all medicla kits are created equal. The table below outlines the individual ranks of consumable medical kits available throughout the world. The Quin prices for consumable medical kits can be found in 0300 - The Rules of Engagement/Understanding Equipment in the "Item Prices by Material Rank" table.

| Rank | Healing Die |
|------|-------------|
| E    | 1d4         |
| D    | 1d6         |
| C    | 1d8         |
| B    | 1d10        |
| A    | 1d12        |
| S    | 1d20        |

When healing using any rank of consumable medical kit, add your Aptitude Modifier. 

Additionally, you are able to use medical techniques or consumable medical kits to revive fallen allies using consumable medical kits. If you do not have the First Aid enhancement under the Medical training, you will be forced to spend 3 Actions to revive an ally and the maximum Hit Points they are restored is 1, regardless of the Rank of the consumable medical kit.
## Barrier Techniques

(1) The Barriers have a DC of 10 + STA. If an attack roll made against the barriers is higher than its DC, the barrier shatters.
(2) When a barrier is broken, the remaining damage dealt to the character previously protected by the barrier is still halved.
(3) Individual barriers have individual health pools equal to your STA health base.
(4) The number of barriers that can be active simultaneously

## Charge Techniques

For some heroes, the full weight of their true strength requires a prolonged investment of time and energy to manifest. This creates a unique tradeoff for heroes that utilize Charge techniques, as they are forced to spend downtime in the heat of combat in order to gain a massive offensive advantage over their foes that could not be achieved in any other context.

The strength of a Charge Technique is determined by the wielding hero's Control Rank and Technique Rank.

The Control Rank increases the nunber of dice that is used by the Charge Technique. The table below lists the number as it corresponds to the hero's Control Rank.

| Control Rank | Number of Dice Used |
|--------------|---------------------|
| E            | 1                   |
| D            | 2                   |
| C            | 3                   |
| B            | 4                   |
| A            | 5                   |
| S            | 6                   |

The Technique Rank of the Charge Technique determines how many actions points that can be used in amplifying the numerical power of the Charge Technique. The table below lists the size of the dice used when rendering the effects of the Charge Technique and how many actions must be taken to achieve that size as it corresponds to the Technique Rank of the Charge Technique.

| Technique Rank | Size of Dice Used | Actions Charged |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| E              | 1d4               | 2               |
|                | 1d6               | 3               |
| D              | 1d8               | 4               |
| C              | 1d10              | 5               |
| B              | 1d12              | 6               |
| A              | 1d20              | 7               |
|                | 1d60              | 8               |
| S              | 1d100             | 9               |

The Activation Cost of a Charge Technique follows the normal Limit Point costs for techniques of equal rank; however, for every three Action Points spent on charging the Charge Technique, an additional cost of half the Activation Cost is added to the total running cost. Once the desired amount of Action Points have been invested into the Charge Technique and the roll to determine whether the Charge Technique successfully hits has been made, the accumulated Limit Point cost is rendered. If assuming the accumulated Limit Point cost of the technique results in the hero exhausting his or her Limit Pool, the hero follows the standard rules for Quirk Exhausting in addition to losing the Turn that follows the hero's recovery from Quirk Exhausting.

While a hero is in the process of charging the Charge Technique, they only may take the Tank Defensive Action in response to an incoming attack and they may not use Reaction Techniques. If an opponent that successfully makes an attack against the hero that is in the process of charging and the opponent's resulting roll is +10 over the hero's Defensive Action, the hero loses concentration (and, by extension, any and all Action Points invested) but must only pay the initial Activation Cost.
## Reaction Techniques

Reaction Techniques are such that provide a tangible bonuses on top of your standard Defensive Action. Most Reaction Techniques specify a focus on _Dodge_ or _Tank_ and may then only be activated in circumstances where that focused Defensive Action is evoked. This specificity allows for such techniques to yield stronger bonuses for the user overall.

**Dodge-focused Techniques**
Dodge-focused Techniques are such that provide the wielder a one-time numerical bonus that contributes to the success of a standard _Dodge_ Defensive Action. This bonus is applied to the roll made by the wielder to perform the _Dodge_ Defensive Action but before the outcome of the roll has been determined within the context of the world. The mechanical benefit of utilizing this technique is that better ensures that the wielder survives a direct encounter with a fatal attack with the only cost rendered being Limit Points.

**Tank-focused Techniques**
Tank-focused Techniques are such that provide the wielder a one-time damage bonus to the attack made using the
