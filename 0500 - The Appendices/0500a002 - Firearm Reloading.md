A reloading mechanic for firearms can be adapted in a custom fashion at the discretion of the Gamemaster, or based on the following principles:

1. There is no "reloading" action. Instead, player characters possess a quantity of generic bullets appropriate for the firearm being wielding and every time the gun is fired as an action, a bullet is subtracted from the total
2. There is a "reloading" action that occurs after a previously determined number of bullets have been expended, according to a "clip" size as it relates to the firearm being wielded. This "reloading" action must be taken for the gun to be usuable as a weapon.
