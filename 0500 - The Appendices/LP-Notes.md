# LP-Notes

Limit Points are a crucial resource for any character in the My Hero Academia universe, representing the amount of energy that can be spent on the activation and maintenance of Quirk-based abilities. Each character has a maximum number of Limit Points that they can spend (referred to as a character's Limit Pool), which is determined by their Control Rank. The following table shows the base Limit Pool value that corresponds to a character's Control Rank. This value is supplemented by a character's Stamina modifier.

| Control Rank | Limit Pool |
|--------------|------------|
| D            | 6          |
| C            | 9          |
| B            | 13         |
| A            | 18         |
| S            | 24         |

When using a Technique, the character must spend a certain number of Limit Points to activate it. The cost of activation varies depending on the Rank of the Technique, with more powerful Techniques generally requiring a higher number of Limit Points to activate.

Some Techniques also have a maintenance cost, which represents the energy to sustain the Technique over time. This cost is usually half the activation cost of the technique in question but must be paid every turn that the Technique is maintained.

## Replenishing the Limit Pool

Many encounters between heroes and villains ultimately become a matter of endurance as they are able to restore their energy passively through the regenerative powers granted to them by their Quirks.

The amount of Limit Points restored back to a character at the start of their turn in combat, or their Limit Refresh Rate, is equal to half of that character's Spirit modifier rounded up.

## Limit Bursting

Limit Bursting refers to act of trigging the sudden onset of a dehabilitating physical and mental state by taking an action which depletes the remaining Limit Points in a character's Limit Pool during their turn in combat. When this occurs, that character usually suffers some physical or mental strain from their overextension. The manifested consequences of this kind of strain is known as Quirk Exhaustion.

Quirks, at all times, seek to stablize the biological environment of the wielder in which they revive so that even though a character may suffer Quirk Exhaustion due to the limitations of their physical body, the Quirk overclocks the dispersal of energy to restore the wielder's available Limit Points to half their Limit Pool.

Though the exact extent and long-form consequences of doing so are severely under-documented, a Quirk wielder can survive several instances of Limit Bursting and continue to participate in high-stress situations, although that wielder may accrue several stacking effecs of Quirk Exhaustion. The number of Limit Bursts that a wielder can take is unique to each one.

### Quirk Exhaustion

There is no thorough understanding of how the effects of Quirk Exhaustion might manifest in the physiology of a Quirk wielder, although it seems that such effects are not discriminate. That is, a wielder that Limit Bursts may find themselves penalized by any part of their physical or mental makeup, regardless of a necessary relevance to that wielder's Quirk (although there is a bias for favoring debuffs that are relevant to the Quirk).

Quirk Exhaustion is, however, usually temporary and non-fatal (at least the effects of the exhaustion itself is not fatalâ€”some external force may take advantage of the new weakness).

For example, a character that Limit Bursts might manifest Quirk Exhaustion in the form of a -2 penalty to their Speed modifier for the duration of 2 turns. If no further Limit Bursts are suffered, then that penalty naturally passess as the Quirk's regenerative nature is quick enough to restore biochemical equilibrium in a wielder. However, subsequent Limit Bursts may result in entirely new effects of Quirk Exhaustion manifesting or pre-existing effects multiplying in both intensity and duration. So that the -2 penalty to Speed for 2 turns may, after another Limit Burst, may worsen to the state of a -4 penalty to Speed for a renewed duration of 4 turns, regardless of how much time as elapsed into the pre-existing penalty.

The Gamemaster is able to define the inflicted effects of Quirk Exhaustion at their distrection.
