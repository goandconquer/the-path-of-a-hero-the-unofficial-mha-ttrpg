## Skill Checks

The basis for all acts of heroism or villainy in the world of *My Hero Academia* lies in how a person's talents and trainings contribute to the success or failures of the actions that they carry out throughout their careers. As your character experiences the living, breathing world, they will often have to prove themselves through their actions.

A **Skill Check** refers to any roll made by a player to determine the relative success or failure of any action that their character performs in the world, with the threshold being determined by the Gamemaster. Unless otherwise stated, the successfulness of an action is determined by the sum of a value generated by a roll of a d20 and the modifier of the Skill associated with the type of action being performed.

The exact way the results of a given Skill Check manifest in the world is determined by the Gamemaster. They may opt for a specific rule for accomplishing this, such as implementing a "pass-or-fail" threshold or a more nuanced "success-with-consequences" philosophy to fit the thematic needs of the story. In any case, the balance should be discussed with the players to ensure that expectations are set and there is no ill-will in how events may play out for the players.
### Criticals

The world of *My Hero Academia* is marked by the constant struggle between those who would use their supernatural strength for the good of their peers and those that would use that same strength to exploit their peers for their own benefit. Competition is a frequent aspect life for the characters, and the balance of power is ever shifting.

A **Critical** refers to the additional condition which is applied in any scenario where two characters make opposing Skill Checks against each other and the difference between the two values (after modifiers are applied) is 10 or more. In such cases, the owner of the lower value may suffer an additional impairment or the owner of the higher value may gain an additional boon in the aftermath of the Skill Check.

The exact assignment or nature of the impairment or boon is left to the determination of the Gamemaster.

Criticals only apply in combat.
### Naturals

In the world of *My Hero Academia*, the spirit of heroism dwells inside of everyone. Even normal people can be capable of incredible displays of power while Heroes and Villains that possess Quirks or the proper rigorous trainings experience the upper limit of their abilities every day, replicating incredible feats in the most simplistic of actions. Yet, even the mightiest can fall to a miscalculation.

A **Natural** refers to the scenario in which the value generated by a Skill Check (prior to the modifiers being applied) is a 20 or a 1. In the case of a value of 20, the character that performed the Skill Check receives one Plus Ultra Points. That value (summed with the applied modified) is then interpreted according to the standard rules. In the case of a 1, the character that performed the Skill Check must spend a Plus Ultra Point (if they have one to spend) and reroll. The value generated by the reroll (after the appropriate modifiers are applied) must be taken as is and cannot be modified by any additional Plus Ultra Points, though any technique or enhancement that affects the value that would normally do so still applies.

Thematically, Naturals represent the ebb and flow of a character's relationship with the unseen forces that imbue their Quirks with the power that they employ every day. In rolling a 20, the character might suddenly feel mystifyingly encouraged by their decisions and carry them out with an optimism they might not usually possess. In rolling a 1, the character might sudden have their instinct betray them and they might need to fill the newfound mental breach with a overclocking of their inherent powers, often to significant consequences.

Naturals only apply outside of combat.
### Ties

In the heat of battle, heroes and villains strive to perform at their best. Lost in the frenzy of blows, they often find themselves locked in a bitter struggle to overpower each other but neither side seems to want to give with so much on the line.

A **Tie** is what occurs when two characters make opposing roles and the values generated by both sides (after applying the appropriate modifiers) turn out to be the same.

Ties and their consequences are felt most intensely within the *Path of the Hero* system in instances of combat. In combat, there is a designated **attacker**, the character that initiated the offensive maneuver, often on their turn, and **defender**, the character that is the target of the offensive maneuver initiated by the attack.

In situations where the defender has taken the Dodge Defensive Action against the attacker's offensive maneuver, the defender takes half of the damage dealt by the attacker's offensive maneuver and is able to expend their half of their movement speed immediately after the attack is made.

In situations where the defender has taken the Tank Defensive Action against the attacker's offensive maneuver, the defender takes half of the damage dealt by the attacker's offensive maneuver but is not gain advantage on their next action taken against the attack as with a normally successful Tank Defensive Action.

In situations where the attacker is utilizing Mental Techniques against the defender as part of their offensive maneuver, the defender takes half damage but does not suffer the loss of their action economy as usually specified in the description of the technique being used.

The resolution of Ties involving competing Skill Checks (that is, any rolls made to perform a non-damage-dealing action, in or outside of combat) is left to the discretion of the Gamemaster, as the consequences of a tie in such thematic moments can affect one, many, or all parties involved in the tie and help or hinder them based on what might be expected from the natural progression of the competing actions.

In situations where one or more characters are making Skill Checks against a static threshold set by the Gamemaster, the tie always goes to the Gamemaster.
## Damage

### Critical Damage

### Grave Counters

## Status Effects

### Concentration

Concentration refers to the attention required to maintain a certain action or technique, and is easily maintained even in the heat of battle. Any technique that has an associated Maintenance Cost is assumed to require concentration on the part of the technique user. Whether any given action requires concentration on the character is up to the gamemaster in that individual situation; therefore, a gamemaster's ruling in one circumstance may not necessarily persist to another.

Concentration may only be broken when the concentrating character is successfully targeted by a Mental Technique or if the concentrating character has an insufficient number of Limit Points needed to maintain their concentration.
### Preparation

A character enters **preparation** when they use a technique or other mechanical function which requires them to spend actions or turns prior to the effects of that mechanical function taking place. This state is thematically encapsulated in moments where characters must muster some internal resource in order to perform an otherwise costly feat of heroism.

Each mechanical function will define the extent of the preparation state and the threshold for its interruption in its specific text.
## Action Economy

The clash between heroes and villains feel like an inconceivable and chaotic brawl between titans to the naked eyes of the civilians around them, but the most prominent and experienced fighters know that combat is instead a delicate dance between adversaries, where a single mistake can result in fatal consequences. In the heat of battle, the ebb and flow is sacred.

Combat within the *Path of a Hero* system is carried out in **Rounds**, each lasting ten (10) in-game seconds, wherein players take **Turns** that encompass their actions within the world. A Round is complete when all players have each taken their Turn to completion. In between the end of one Round and the start of another, the Gamemaster may deem it necessary to switch the focus from Combat to a non-combat situation (especially if other players are not involved in the Combat) or generally provide further exposition for the scene depending on its thematic nature.

A **Turn** is comprised of any combination of actions, reactions, techniques, movements, and specials that a player has at their disposal. A Player is allotted three (3) **Actions** and one (1) **Reaction** at the start of their Turn. In rare cases, a player might afford themselves more Actions or Reactions based on the rules associated with that mechanics.
### Actions

**Actions** (sometimes referred to as **Action Points**) serve as the narrative and mechanical foundation for what a hero (or villain) can do during their Turn in the Instinct Order, acting as the currency that players to manifest their intentions into the game world. Just as heroes (and villain) in *My Hero Academia* must decide whether to engage in combat, help (or harm) a bystander, or focus on a tactical advantage, players must determine how to best utilize their Actions to align with their goals and strategies.

At the start of their Turn, a player has three (3) Actions to use. These may be spent to carry out any standard Actions available to any character, regardless of whether or not they possess a Quirk, such as making a freeform melee attack (unarmed, or with a weapon), a freeform ranged attack (with an appropriate weapon), using an item, interacting with objects, or moving. A player may suggest an alternative to constitute the use of their Action at the DM's discretion. In addition, players that possess a character with the means to do so may expend Actions to active and utilize the power of their Quirks through the use of **Techniques**.
### Techniques

**Techniques** are the specialized, high-octane, Quirk-powered abilities that allow players to harness the innate powers in astounding ways. Just as All Might's "United States of Smash" resonates as a symbol of indomitable justice, and Todoroki's "Heaven-Piercing Ice Wall" exemplifies his dual nature, your Techniques are more than just powerful moves—they are the signature expressions of your character's spirit, skill, and aspirations.

#### Trained Techniques

#### Freeform Techniques
### Reactions

A player may opt to perform an **Action Exchange** in which the player exchanges one of their Action Points to gain an additional Reaction to use after their Turn has ended. A player may only perform this exchange once on their Turn. If the exchanged Reaction is not used before the start of their Turn, then it is lost.
### Instinct Order

Instinct Order is the relative hierarchy of speed and intuition determined by the presence of Heroes and Villains at the start of a Combat instance. At the Gamemaster's announcement, each player makes an Aptitude (or other appropriate Skill Attribute determined by special rules) roll to determine the order in which play will commence throughout a Round. This order holds for the entirety of a Combat instance unless otherwise prompted by the Gamemaster.
### Defensive Actions

**Dodging**

Inflicting a Critical while taking the Dodge Defensive Action yields the player a single free action that they may take immediately after the offensive maneuver made against them concludes. 

**Tanking**

Inflicting a Critical while taking the Tank Defensive Action yields the player a result of all incoming damage that the offensive maneuver made against them would otherwise inflict being negated.
