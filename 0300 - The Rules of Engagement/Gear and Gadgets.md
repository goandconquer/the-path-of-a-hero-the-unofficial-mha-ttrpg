## Firearms

In the world of My Hero Academia, firearms are powerful ranged weapons that are used by both heroes and villains. They come in various shapes and sizes, and are made of different materials that determine their durability. The most common types of firearms in the series are handguns and rifles, but other types such as shotguns and submachine guns can also be seen.

**Firearms**

Each firearm has a Material Rank that determines its durability. The higher the material rank of the firearm, the more durable it is. These firearms are typically of made of advanced materials that are capable of withstanding high levels of stress and impact. They are also designed to be lightweight and easy to handle, allowing for quick and accurate shots.

**Bullets**

Bullets also have a material rank that determines the damage dealt by the firearm that fires them. These bullets can vary in size, shape and material, and are designed to deliver different types of damage depending on the situation. For example, a hero might use a bullet made of a special type of metal that explodes on impact, while a villain might use a bullet made of a special type of hardened plastic that can pierce through armor.

If a bullet of a higher material rank is discharged from a firearm of a lower material rank, there is a chance that a firearm misfires and is rendered inoperable. This is why heroes and villains often use firearms that are of a material rank that is equal to or greater than the bullet they plan to use.

**Rubber Bullets**

All firearms may fire a "fake" rubber bullet that deal an unchanging 3d8. Rubber bullets can be fired using Freeform Techniques. These are often used by heroes when they want to capture a villain alive, or when they want to avoid causing unnecessary damage to the surrounding area.

**Range**

A firearm that discharges "real" bullets must do so via an activated Trained Weapon Technique whose Technique Rank whose rank is equal to or greater than the material rank of the bullet and the material rank of the firearm. The rank of a Trained Weapon Technique determines the range at which the bullet fired can reach, based on the following table:

| Rank      | Range       |
|-----------|-------------|
| E         | 2           |
| D         | 5           |
| C         | 10          |
| B         | 25          |
| A         | 50          |
| S         | 100         |

**Reloading**

Reloading firearms can be adapted in a custom fashion at the discretion of the Gamemaster. However, two main principles can opted for use as a basis for the reloading mechanic:

- **No Reloading Action:** Player characters possess a quantity of generic bullets appropriate for the firearm being wielded. Every time the gun is fired as an Action, a bullet is subtracted from the total. This eliminates the need for a specific reloading action and allows for a more fluid combat experience.

- **Reloading Action:** A "reloading" action is required after a previously determined number of bullets have been expended, according to a "clip" size as it relates to the firearm being wielded. This "reloading" action must be taken for the gun to be useable as a weapon.

In both cases, the reloading process can be influenced by Quirks, Trained Weapon Techniques, or items. Characters with Quirks that allow them to create bullets or manipulate metal could have an infinite amount of bullets or reload much faster than others. Trained Weapon Techniques could allow characters to reload faster or more effectively when used with items such as speed loaders or special holsters could enhance the reloading process.
