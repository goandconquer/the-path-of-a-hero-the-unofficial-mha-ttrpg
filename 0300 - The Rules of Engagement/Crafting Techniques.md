## Area of Effect Techniques

## Barrier Techniques

## Status Techniques

Status Techniques are techniques that bestow a beneficial or detrimental effect upon a target for a short period of time. While many aspects of a target can be affected by such techniques, the most common applications are increasing or reducing a target's modifier when they attempt to use a Skill designated by the technique, or by either increasing or reducing a target's Damage Output when they make attacks. The table below shows the appropriate values to be added or subtracted from the target based on the Control Rank of the technique.

| Rank | Skills    | Damage Output |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| E    | ±1 SKILL  | ±1 DMG        |
| D    | ±2 SKILL  | ±1d4 DMG      |
| C    | ±3 SKILL  | ±1d6 DMG      |
| B    | ±5 SKILL  | ±1d8 DMG      |
| A    | ±7 SKILL  | ±1d10 DMG     |
| S    | ±10 SKILL | ±1d12 DMG     |

Status Techniques must be created with either a beneficial or detrimental effect in mind. A single technique may not bestow more than one effect, but multiple Status Techniques can be defined for a single character given that the necessary Technique Points are available to do so. A player may collaborate with the gamemaster to define the extent of the effect on other aspects of a target.

%% #todos: You may only have one Technique that has a Maintenance Cost active at any time. Transformation Quirks are the exception, as they can have their Transformation Technique on top of that one Technique. %%

If the technique is created with a detrimental effect in mind, then the selected target may make a Saving Roll against the technique user's Spirit to avoid being affected by the technique. If use of the technique relies on the technique user's Quirk to feasible work, then the technique user instead rolls using their Quirk Focus. If use of the technique relies on the sheer non-Quirk martial capabilities of the technique user's Quirk, then the technique user rolls using either Accuracy or Aptitude.

The Activation Cost is determined normally by the Control Rank of the technique.

The Maintenance Cost of the technique is equal to half the Activation Cost. At the start of their turn, a player may opt to release the technique before the cost is deducted from their Limit Pool. If the technique is released, the defined effects are no longer bestowed upon the target and the player must pay the Activation Cost again to replicate the effects.

Status Techniques use [concentration](Mastering%20Combat.md#Concentration) while they are maintained.
## Stance Techniques

%% Copy version of Fighting Styles and Stances as they are presented in book--the damage %% 

Stance Techniques are similar to [Status Techniques](Crafting%20Techniques.md#status-techniques) in that their use renders an increase to some aspect of a character, but at the cost of enabling or intensifying weaknesses which creep into the tactical picture. This thematically translates into certain characters having postures, preferences, and states of mind, or

## Physical Techniques

Physical Techniques are any technique that relies on the use of the technique user's body, and therefore operate as the umbrella technique for other physical-based techniques listed in this section.

A Physical Technique which is defined to deal damage to a target uses the table located at [Technique and Freeform Damage](../0500%20-%20The%20Appendices/Technique%20and%20Freeform%20Damage.md) under the "Physical Techniques" column. These techniques may only have an associated Range of Melee, which is two (2) meters.
## Quirk Techniques

A Quirk Technique is any technique whose use only makes sense when considered in the context of the technique user's Quirk. It is by design that this kind of technique is left to the interpretation of the player (and, by extension, the gamemaster), as a Quirk should made powerful by the creative energies of the player that controls the technique user.

At the moment, the only Quirk Techniques defined by the rulebook are the [Transformation Techniques](Crafting%20Techniques.md#transformation-techniques), due to the specificity of their function.

## Reaction Techniques

In the world of *My Hero Academia*, every hero knows that to achieve greatness requires not only a mastery of decisive strategy and cunning, but a tempered intuition to guide them through the chaos that overwhelms even the most robust and thorough plans. With innocents counting on them, allies looking up to them, and villains vying to defeat them, the factor that determines whether the hero lives or dies comes down to his ability to respond without thinking.

A **Reaction Technique** is a special technique type that allows characters to utilize their Quirk or martial abilities when it is no longer their turn. This asynchronous timing engages them even when they are no longer the focus, as a well-intentioned reaction can disrupt pivotal changes in the tide of battle and ensure they remain out of harm's way. Reaction Techniques are often defensively oriented, improving the odds and intensity with which a character is able to avoid the negatives associated with the offensive maneuvers that target them. Reaction Techniques may only be used if a character has not yet used their Reaction in the combat round in some other fashion.

**Dodge-focused & Tank-focused Reaction Techniques**

Reaction Techniques can augment the Defensive Actions through the provision of bonuses applied directly to the respective rolls made for them. The cost to activate the Reaction Technique is determined by its Rank. The application of these bonuses are the same for either Defensive Action type, however the Reaction Technique may only target one or the other at the time of the technique's definition. Additionally, there is a difference in how the bonuses are calculated based on whether the technique is being deployed by a character with an Emitter Quirk or not.

In the case of a non-Emitter Quirk character using a Reaction Technique of this type, the Defensive Action receives a static bonus according to the table found on the *Buff & Debuff Techniques* section. Emitter Quirk characters apply the value generated by a roll of their Quirk Die.

This means that Emitters typically feature more powerful uses of such techniques as the potency of their Reaction Technique is not determined by its Rank, but rather the denomination of the Quirk Die that they have. However, a Tier 4 Emitter Quirk character does not gain any benefit from the use of this kind of technique since they are not afforded any denomination of Quirk Die. 

Non-Emitter Quirk characters may only increase the potency of their Reaction Technique via the upgrading of the Rank (thereby increasing the cost of the technique at the same time as the bonus value increases).

**Counters**

A **Counter** is a type of Reaction Technique that focuses on allowing a character to retaliate against an enemy that makes them the target of an offensive maneuver. With this technique, the character that deploys it rolls as if they are making a normal Defensive Action (therefore, they choose Tank or Dodge). The value generated is then checked against the To Hit of the offensive maneuver that targeted them. If the value is higher than the To Hit, the character may deal damage equal to the Technique Rank Damage table according to the Rank of the Technique. The Limit Point cost is determined according to the standard rules. A Counter may use Weapons damage and bonuses. 

**Reflects**

Reflected status effects take an action to dismiss.

## Synchronization Techniques

## Transformation Techniques

Transformation Techniques are special techniques only learnable by characters that possess a [Transformation Quirk](../0200%20-%20The%20Fundamental%20Elements%20of%20a%20Hero/Unlocking%20Your%20Quirk.md#Transformation%20Quirks) and specifically define the mechanics behind how a character assume and release their active transformation state. A character may only ever have one Transformation Technique defined unless in special circumstances where it makes thematic sense to have varying transformations. 

The Activation Cost is determined normally by the Control Rank of the technique, and the cost is only rendered when a character is assuming their active transformation state. There is no cost associated with releasing their active transformation state.

The Maintenance Cost is equal by the number of Limit Points that a character's Limit Refresh Rate would normally provide at the start of their turn, essentially setting their Limit Refresh Rate to zero (0) as long as the character is assuming their active transformation state; however, a player may collaborate with the gamemaster to determine thematically appropriate ways to recover Limit Points while their character is assuming their active transformation state.

These techniques does not count against a character's total number of Technique Points.
