# The Path of a Hero: The Unofficial My Hero Academia TTRPG

**What is this?**

*The Path of a Hero* is a fan-made, unofficial, and comprehensive reimagining of the highly popular anime and manga series *My Hero Academia* created and published by Kōhei Horikoshi, Shueisha, Viz Media, and many other contributors as a table-top role-playing system. This system adapts the settings, characters, and lore of the source material but in no way claims to possess any rights to it. The stories, mechanics, or any other content not directly related to existing source material found in this system should not be considered part of the official canon. They are merely here for the appreciation and enjoyment of the spirit of *My Hero Academia* as a work of fiction. Please support the official releases.

**Who created this?**

Kōhei Horikoshi, Shueisha, Viz Media, and many other contributors are the creators and holders of all applicable rights for *My Hero Academia*.

Inspiration for many of the mechanics featured in this system comes from those developed by forum-based role-playing community found at http://myheroacademiarp.com.

*The Path of a Hero* was first drafted by Juanito Marquez as an unfinished and unpolished prototype systen.

Playtesters that provided feedback pivotal to the development of the system (in alphabetical order) include: 

- Caleb Brown
- David Carey
- David Goforth
- Deborah Fiddler
- Erik Nieman
- Grayson Henderson
- Nathan Goforth
- Trey Reynolds

...and many others.

In 2022, Caleb Brown and David Goforth began a comprehensive revision of the prototype system. This repository is that revision.
