## What is this?

*The Path of a Hero* is a fan-made, unofficial, and comprehensive reimagining of the highly popular anime and manga series *My Hero Academia* created and published by Kōhei Horikoshi, Shueisha, Viz Media, and many other contributors as a table-top role-playing system. This system adapts the settings, characters, and lore of the source material but in no way claims to possess any rights to it. The stories, mechanics, or any other content not directly related to existing source material found in this system should not be considered part of the official canon. They are merely here for the appreciation and enjoyment of the spirit of *My Hero Academia* as a work of fiction. Please support the official releases.

## Who created this?

Kōhei Horikoshi, Shueisha, Viz Media, and many other contributors are the creators and holders of all applicable rights for *My Hero Academia*.

Inspiration for many of the mechanics featured in this system comes from those developed by forum-based role-playing community found at http://myheroacademiarp.com.

*The Path of a Hero* was first drafted by Juanito Marquez as an unfinished and unpolished prototype systen.

Playtesters that provided feedback pivotal to the development of the system (in alphabetical order) include: 

- Caleb Brown
- David Carey
- David Goforth
- Deborah Fiddler
- Erik Nieman
- Grayson Henderson
- Nathan Goforth
- Trey Reynolds

...and many others.

In 2022, Caleb Brown and David Goforth began a comprehensive revision of the prototype system. This repository is that revision.

The system itself is broken up into the following chapters:

1. **The Front Matter:** This chapter contains any housekeeping information not connected to the system and its presentation, such as disclaimers or forewords.
2. **The World of the Powers and the Powerless:** This chapter contains the historical information that may assist incoming players in understanding the grander context of the world that the system takes place in, as well as the characterizations and background concepts that players should keep in mind when creating a realistic character for this universe.
3. **The Fundamental Elements of a Hero:** This chapter contains the foundational mechanical concepts of the systems, such as the attributes, resources, and abilities that come from a player-character's Quirk and training.
4. **The Rules of Engagement:** This chapter builds off of the previous chapter to introduce the overall combat-and-action system which is the main means of players engaging with the world at large, such as limit points, techniques, equipment, and death.
5. **The Villains of This Age:** This chapter introduces DM-centered information on how to flesh out the encounters, story arcs, and overall campaign-related topics that create compelling gameplay for the party.
6. **The Appendices:** This chapter contains any information agnostic of the previously-introduced chapters or is considered optional in the context of the rest of the system.

As a reminder, this is an ongoing project. Any information presented in this README may be out of date and any organizational elements or content may change at any point.
