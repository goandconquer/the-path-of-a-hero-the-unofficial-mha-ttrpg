# [[0200a001 - Discovering Your Background]]

The most remarkable trait of Quirks is their ability to completely alter the trajectory of a person's life when they manifest. Individuals who possess such powers are ushered into a world so different from anything they have every known. Many times, this occurs without any possibility of returning from it. But fate is not always so malicious in its conscription. A person who has endured a life filled with unfairness and cruelty can be given the physical strength to match the spiritual resistance that they have always had within them. In the same vein, it can humble worldly people and encourage them to abandon their lavish lifestyle in favor of a life of generosity and honor worthy of their status.

Your character's background plays a significant role in the storytelling process in many ways. In fact, this is often the first decision players make in order to better understand their campaign's setting as well as the avatar they inhabit. By determining the kind of upbringing, family, and environment that a character will receive, you can inadvertenly set the stage for their future choices.

You should always think about your character beyond their origins, and they should typically have room to grow outside their origins, but their background is a great indicator of what kind of hero (or villain) they will be. Choose wisely.
