# Heroic Trainings

## Tinkerer

**\[1 EP\] Apprenticeship**
Whether from countless hours poured into it as a hobby or from having a mentor in the business to show you all the ins and outs of the trade, your understanding of invention and technology has really grown into something profound but you still lack the authority to create items without the proper supervision. When working under the watchful eye of a licensed professional, you may make items from materials as high as B-rank.

**\[2 EP\] Jerry Rigging**
Your time under supervision has given you insight to more of the spontaneous and resourceful states of mind necessary for being an advanced gadgeteer. Items that you make under licensed supervision can be created using A-ranked materials. When making repair checks, you gain a +3 bonus to them. You are also able to make short-term repairs to damaged or broken items in the field using the bare minimum of parts. When it is your turn, you may spend three actions to restore the item to an operable state. As soon as combat is over, the item ceases to work and must be brought to a professional for lasting repairs.

**\[3 EP\] Tinkerer's License**
You have now since transcended the limits of what any licensed professional could instruct you on, having demonstrated your proficiency in resourcefulness and attention to detail through your craft. You now have a profession license of your own, which enables you to create any piece of conceivable equipment without supervision as well as use up to five gadgets at a time in public. When creating items inside of a industry-standard workshop, you are able to create items using S-ranked materials. Outside of workshops, you are limited to using C-ranked materials for your item creation. You are able to bypass the requirement of _Gadget Handler_ in the _Gadget License_ collection and you receive a 1 EP discount when picking up _My Armory_ and _Power Fluent_ from the _Gadget License_ collection.

****
## Medical

**\[1 EP\] First Aid**
If you possess a healing-based Quirk, you no longer require consumable medical kits to perform substantive healing. Additionally, Your Medical Techniques now heal according to the maximum obtainable value of the scaling dice table found under the "Healing Techniques" section of "Understanding Techniques" plus your Aptitude. The Rank of the Medical Technique in question determines the dice used. Additionally, you are now able to revive fallen allies and subsequently heal them a number of Hit Points equal to the Rank of the Medical Technique being used plus your Aptitude as seen under the same section.

If you do not possess a healing-based Quirk when picking up this training, then you are able to perform a free-form technique to use a consumable medical kit to heal an ally a number of Hit Points equal to 1 plus your Aptitude Modifier. Likewise, you are able to revive a fallen ally to 1 Hit Point as a free-form technique.

If you do not have this training but you have a medical-based quirk or a consumable medical kit, you will be forced to spend 3 Actions and use Limit to revive an ally as normal. 

**\[2 EP\] Battle Nurse**
You have conditioned yourself to tune out the chaos and noise of an active battlefield and focus instead on your life-saving work. For each turn in which you spend an action healing an ally, you receive a rolling bonus to your Aptitude modifier (minimum of 1) on each consecutive turn that you do this, up to a total bonus of +5.

**\[3 EP\] Dr. Who?**
You have earned access to a static D-ranked Practiced Technique that does not cost you a technique point to learn. When you use this technique, you may approach an ally and touch them in order to establish a continuous medical connection that enables you to heal them without being physically close to them. On each turn after its use, you may choose to spend a number of Limit Points equal to the full activation cost plus half that same cost in order to heal them 1d4 Health Points equal. In addition, at the beginning of each consecutive turn that this technique is active, you must roll a Stamina check in order to maintain concentration. You receive a +3 bonus to this check. If you fail this check, the medical connection is broken and the technique ends.

****
## Speed Demon (Emitters)

**\[1 EP] SPEED FORCED** 
Speed quirks are some of the most varied in Hero Society. For you, your body naturally emits something that allows faster movement than a normal human body allows. You are able to generate great force without technique or power, using the force generated from your speed to augment your punches. You may add your Quirk Tier Die to the damage of Physical Techniques instead of adding it to your Roll to Hit.

**\[2 EP] ACT NOW, THINK LATER** 
Quirks often speak to the nature of the individual who wields them. Having a quirk that accelerates you means you most likely don’t want to wait around for the bad guys to make the first move. Your impulsive nature and need for action lets you initiate combat faster than others can think. Instead of Aptitude, you may roll Speed for your Instinct roll. You may also add half of your Speed modifier to Physical Techniques for your Roll to Hit if you use your Quirk Tier Die for damage.

**\[3 EP] FIST FAST AS LIGHTNING**
After training your body, you have mastered your ability to move at incredible speeds. You may make a barrage of punches faster than the eye can see or your movement creates a sonic boom as you go. Anytime you use a Movement Technique, you may roll damage from the AoE table equal to one lower than your Movement Technique Rank plus your Quirk Tier Die. This counts as an AoE attack for the purposes of buffs and enhancements, and enemies may still roll defensive rolls.

****
## **SPEED DEMON (Mutation)**

**\[1 EP] FAST ADAPTATION** 
Many types of speed quirks are the results of adaptations of the body, granting superhuman agility and acceleration. You know what it takes to make your body move the way you want it, and your unique physiology allows you to do things other speedsters can’t. You may add your highest Quirk Tier Bonus to your Roll to Hit for Physical Techniques. (This does stack with the Quirk Tier Bonus added to Accuracy or Power for base play, or if you use an enhancement to change your Roll to Hit for Physical Techniques to Speed.)  Additionally, when you use a movement technique, you may spend your Reaction and additional LP equal to the technique used to move an additional distance equal to your movement speed. After you move in this way, you must spend an Action Point doing something other than movement.

**\[2 EP] THE NATURE OF SPEED** 
Speed is your natural element. Moving at incredible speeds is almost like muscle memory, allowing you to focus on all that is in front of you. You may roll Speed instead of Aptitude for Instinct Rolls. Additionally, you may add your Highest Quirk Tier Bonus to the damage of Physical Techniques.

**\[3 EP] I AM LIGHTNING** 
You have pushed your body more than you had previously thought possible. The force of your punches are unmatched, mixed with your ability to bob and weave out of combat. If you spent an Action Point or Reaction on movement, you may spend an additional 2 LP to add your Speed to the damage of a Physical Technique. Counters or Reflects made against that attack have disadvantage against you and you have advantage on the Defensive Action as long as it is the Dodge Defensive Action.

***
## Speed Demon (Transformation)

**\[1 EP] FLASH STEP** 
The rarest form of a speed quirk, a transformation is a temporary burst of speed that exceeds what your body is naturally capable of. When you use a Transformation Technique, you may use your reaction to move up to your Transformed Movement Speed immediately after transforming.

**\[2 EP] GOTTA GO FAST** 
Bursting into a sprint is a taxing endeavor for your body. Your quirk may require more focus and discipline than other speed quirks, but drawing out a battle is also to your detriment. You may roll Speed instead of Aptitude for Instinct rolls, and you may roll Speed instead of Accuracy or Power for the Roll to Hit of Physical Techniques. (You will still use Accuracy or Power for Damage.) When you roll using Speed for the Roll to Hit, you have disadvantage to the Dodge Defensive Roll action. (You do not take disadvantage if you spend the Enhancements to change your Roll to Hit for Physical Techniques)

**\[3 EP] SUPER SONIC STEP**
The human eye cannot keep up with your speed. Any enemy slower than you will always have a slight delay defending against you. Immediately after using Flash Step, you may leave behind an afterimage. After the end of your turn, you may choose whether you are currently in the spot you ended your turn on or are in the position you left your afterimage in. Any enemy wishing to hit you must roll an Accuracy check to know which is the real you. An enemy must designate which position they are attacking. If they successfully choose your position, the enemy has disadvantage to the Roll to Hit. Any sound you make is distorted and comes from both positions. The afterimage disappears if an enemy hits the afterimage, you do not spend an Action Point on Movement, or you end your Transformation. The afterimage automatically fails Defensive Actions. 

****
## Fatgum

\[**1 EP\] Healing Factor**
Pain is an inevitable experience for even the most talented and experience heroes and all heroes handle that pain differently. Some might abandon the fight to lick their wounds, while others will do whatever it takes to avoid it. For you, pain is a welcome pleasure because it means you're doing what's necessary to protect the innocent. While you are in combat, you may gain Health Points equal to half your Stamina modifier every turn that you receive damage from an opponent.

\[**2 EP\] Overheal**
When the hurt is ahead of you, any mental or emotional resource can't be wasted. When you are healed and the number of received Hit Points exceeds what was required to reach your Hit Point maximum, you may keep a number of Hit Points up to the value of your Stamina modifier plus 3 and add it to your current Hit Points, regardless of your maximum.

\[**3 EP\] Right Back 'Atcha**
After sustaining countless injuries, you've learned that the most useful way to deal with pain is to grit your teeth and brace for it. On your turn, you may choose to reserve any number of Action Points, up to a maximum of three, to be used by the Reaction Technique described here.

When it is not your turn and an attack is made against you, you may choose to activate this Reaction Technique and spend one of your reserved Action Points to perform the Tank reaction to effectively absorb the damage dealt by the attack rendered against you. You may repeat this activation in response to a number of attacks equal to the number of Action Points you reserved during your previous turn.

When you have exhausted all of your reserved Action Points, or it has reached the beginning of your next turn, you immediately channel all of the damage that you've accumulated from the activations into an Area of Effect attack whose damage and the number of selectable targets are determined by its Rank, which, in this case, should be the Rank of your Stamina.

For this attack, you spend the number of Limit Points equal to half your Control Rank (minimum of three) times the number of spent Action Points. After calculating the value of the AOE's attack damage, add the accumulated damage to that sum and deal it to the appropriate targets. You have Advantage on this attack.

Any unspent Action Points reserved for this Reaction Technique are lost.

****
## Rescue

Rescue Training is all about how to navigate the uncertain and ever-changing environments that arise when disaster strike. These scenes are often full of smoldering fires, crumbling scenes and structures, and architectural insecurities that make them difficult and dangerous to navigation for even experienced heroes.

Specifically, heroes with Rescue Training are proficient in heading into these environments and bringing the unfortunate innocent out safely, as well as being better at preventing such scenes from becoming a reality. Such heroes are often selfless, quick-to-action, and have solid instincts to guide them through the uncertainty of disaster sites.

**\[1 EP\] Light in the Dark**
The safety of the innocent is of utmost importance, so if violence can be avoid, it is well worth the effort. When trying to keep the peace, whether that's negotiating with villains or calming down panicked crowds, you gain advantage to Spirit rolls.

**\[2 EP\] Till the Light Shines**
There are few that have the heroic endurance necessary to carry themselves through stressful and exhaustive situations, but you are dedicated to the pursuit of the people in need, knowing the stakes. Once every 24 hours, while attempting to rescue a person from a situation or environment that poses a risk to them, you may choose to gain a +6 to Speed or Power for 1 Round.

**\[3 EP\] I Am Here**
The tumultuous environment of an active disaster scene can render even strong spirits weak, as they find themselves unable to swallow the horrific sights of death and destruction. It takes stouthearted leaders to keep them on task and prevent more from being added to the scene. When you are on the field during or after a disaster, any allies within a 50-meter radius of you (including yourself) gains a +5 bonus to Stamina and Spirit until all civilians are rescued.

****
## Crime Fighter

**\[1 EP\] Friendly Neighborhood Vigilante**
As a fledgling hero, you've used the presence of good people as a genuine motiviation to press on harder. For each round of combat that there are civilians nearby, attacks made against you, up to the number of civilians within a number of a meters equal to the Rank of your Speed, have Disadvantage for that round. If a civilian leaves the area or you move too far away, that number is re-evaluated at the start of the next round of combat.

**\[2 EP\] Brass Knuckles**

Some heroes rely solely on their physical strength in combat. When using a Physical Technique to attack an enemy without a gadget or weapon, the hero gains a +3 bonus on rolls to hit and an additional damage die for that attack.

**\[3 EP\] Thug Slugger**
A high-quality hero is worth its weight in villains. When in combat, if you (and your team) are outnumbered, you gain an additional damage die that scales according to the number of opponents you are outnumbered. For 1 opponent, you gain a d4. For 2, gain a d6. For 3, gain a d8. For 4, gain a d10. For 5, gain a d12. For 6 or more, gain a d20. This bonus is applied to all attacks you make.

****
## Private Investigator

**\[1 EP\] Spinning the Web**
The key to catching the bad guys is to never treat a detail as irrelevant. Decide on a mystery. You may only have a single mystery active at any time. You may not follow a new mystery until the current mystery has been seen to its logical end or you acquire Lines of Reasoning. When formulating factual connections in regards to events, environments, or characters surrounding this mystery, you may reference a relevant piece of information, called a clue, that you either remembered or recorded during your time in the field to add a d4 to the check that establishes this new connection. For such a check, you may reference a number of clues equal to your Aptitude modifier. Each additional clue adds an additional d4.

**\[2 EP\] Lines of Reasoning**
You've trained your mind to better keep the whole picture available at a moment's notice, making room for multiple lines of thinking. In addition to your currently active mystery, you may define any number of additional mysteries that might be relevant to your character. While you still may only have one mystery active at any time, you may switch between your active and a dormant mystery at the end of a day. You may not collect clues for a mystery that is not the active mystery, even if it has been defined. When formulating factual connections, you may invoke an epiphany by spending 3 clues, which allows you to automatically succeed the check.

**\[3 EP\] Discombobulate**
Embracing knowledge as power has heighened your offensive capabilities. During combat, you may spend clues up to the number you have recorded to deal additional damage. For each clue spent, add an additional d4 to the damage of your attack.

****
## True Detective

**\[1 EP\] Regular Ole' Sleuth**

You have a knack for sniffing out the truth content of people's words and know when you're having your leg pulled. When interrogating a target for information, you gain a +3 to Accuracy (or another Attribute, at the Gamemaster's discretion). Additionally, targets who attempt to deceive you do so with disadvantage.

**\[2 EP\] Read Like a Book**

Your intuition and attention to detail has reached a superhuman level, allowing you to make critical deductions in the blink of an eye and gain insights that other people wouldn't be able to make for themselves. You gain a number of Deduction Points equal to the modifier determined by your Control Rank that you may spend at any time to acquire information regarding a subject you can see. After spending the point, you may ask the Gamemaster to provide you with a categorical piece of information and then receive it if it is applicable to the situation. For example, if you were to ask the Gamemaster to provide a locational piece of information about the subject, they may reveal some detail about the subject's whereabouts.

**\[3 EP\] It's Elementary, My Dear Watson

You no longer susceptible to the whims and fancies of a charasmatic speaker, only digesting the raw intentionality of their words. Determining the undeniable truth of the matter has become a child's charade. You may now spend a Deduction Point to immediately see through any lie told to you by a target, regardless of their roll. Additionally, you may spend a Deduction Point to immediately convince a target of a lie, regardless of what they roll in response.

## People Pleaser

## Silver Tongue

**\[1 EP\] Yes, And!**

You are a master of maintaining a deflective and mysterious air in the face of extreme scrutiny. When questioned about details that should otherwise give away your identity, you are able to utilize your charisma to dissuade their suspicions and make even the most outlandish excuses come across as absolutely possible in your case. You gain +3 to rolls made to convince someone of your false authority or clearance in a hostile environment. 

**\[2 EP\] The More, the Merrier**

The art of the silver-tongued is to make the deceived feel as if they've been inducted into an exclusive group that guards a juicy secret, no matter how ridiculous. If you have an ally who is willing to back your claims before them, half of their Spirit modifier is added to the roll when convincing targets of your handcrafted deception. 

**\[3 EP\] Facade of the Conspicuous**

The most incredible lies are the ones carried on by the insipid masses. As you successfully convince more and more targets of your grand deceptions, it becomes harder for those not yet convinced to resist the mentality of the mob. For every 2 sucessfully deceived targets, up to twice your Spirit modifier, gain an additional d4 that may be added to the roll made to convince subsequent targets.

**\[1 EP\] Human Shield**

When an ally that is within 5 meters of you takes the Tank Defensive Action to avoid an Area of Effect technique made against them, you may roll as well and take the higher of the two dice. If a roll high enough to successfully pass the check is generated between the two values, then your character jumps in front of your ally and assumes the damage for them, granting you both advantage on your next action. If both of the two generated values fail to pass the check, you take the full damage and your ally takes half. 

**\[2 EP\]  Saving Grace**

There is no sight worse than an ally in pain, so you have reconditioned yourself to ignore the natural fear that your body experiences when placing itself in harm's way. You gain a Reaction Technique that allows you to mitigate the consequences suffered by an ally against whom a successful attack has been made. When you use this technique, whatever negative effect that an enemy's attack would normally deal is reduced by one degree as long the attack is physical and targets only one person. For example, if your ally would normally critically fail when taking the Tank or Dodge Defensive Action against an enemy's attack, they would instead only suffer a normal failure. 

**\[3 EP\] My Hero**

You hold to the traditions of the warrior, forgoing any sense of self-preservation and When an ally within your range of movement achievable by a single action goes down, you may sacrifice half of your remaining Limit Points to stabilize them and bring them back up to a single Hit Point. You may do this once per day. 

****
## Stealth

****
## Inception

****
## Pseudomorph

The art of deception is an unsung branch of the blossoming modern Hero society, though there are some that believe espionage and flash identities are not without their uses in supporting the grander efforts of Heroes to preserve justice. Learning to hone their acting and observational skills to best utilize their quirks, these heroes are masters of disguise and are nearly indistinguishable from the real people they impersonate.

**\[1 EP\] Polymorphed**

When impersonating a target you have spent at least a minute observing, gain a bonus to Spirit and Accuracy checks equal to your Aptitude modifier when convincing others for the first time that you are the target. This bonus does not apply to any attempts made after, nor does it apply to groups where an individual that you previously attempted to convince is present. Once successfully convinced of your ruse, an individual need not make a roll against your deception again unless information contradictory to your persona is presented to them. The individual then performs a roll with advantage with Aptitude or Accuracy against your original roll to deceive them. If they fail, they remain deceived until the next time that new information is presented to them, at which point they realize they have been tricked. While convinced of your ruse, you have advantage on Spirit checks made to persuade or deceive individuals to carry out actions on your behalf.

**\[2 EP\] Chameleon**

Espionage is a volatile endeavor where everything can change at the drop of a hat, and you must be prepared for any situation, especially when your identity is compromised. After an individual succeeds their check against your deception, you have advantage on Speed checks when being stealthy, and you are able to double the distance you cover when spending an Action on Movement once. Additionally, Spirit checks made to convince individuals of a new impersonation do not have disadvantage, including previously encountered individuals who have not yet seen your new impersonation.

**\[3 EP\] Pseudomorphous**

Your method of embodying your target has transcended mere charms and confidence. You may now mimic the techniques of the target you are impersonating. If you already possess a Quirk or technique that allows you to replicate or impersonate an aspect of a target, you may assume and use one of the target's Quirk Techniques, if they have any, at the Rank defined if it is lower than your Control Rank or up to one Rank higher than your Control Rank. You may use this technique once a turn without suffering any negative effects. If you do not already have a Quirk or technique that allows you to replicate or impersonate an aspect of a target, you may instead assume and use one of their Physical Techniques, if they have any, rolling on the Quirk Damage Table.

# General Enhancements

**\[1 EP\] Comeback Kid**
Whenever you are rendered unconscious, you now make your Grave Checks using a 1d12 instead of a d10.

**\[2 EP\] Airbender**
You may now develop physical techniques which can be employed at range according to its rank without the need for ammunition.

****
#todos : Review Concept of "Airbender" with Cal.
****

**\[2 EP\] Clobbering Smash**
Once per turn, choose 1 technique. That technique deals an extra +6 damage whenever it is employed this turn. However, you have disadvantage when employing defensive actions. 

****
#questions : What is a *defensive freeform*? Is this a freeform technique? 
****

**\[2 EP\] Man of Steel**
You now have advantage on defensive rolls against attacks that rely on the use of a physical item or weapon. Additionally, whenever you take the Tank defensive action against a hit, and your roll exceeds the attacker's by 10 or more, and the rank of the item or weapon is lower than the rank of your Stamina, the item or weapon shatters on impact and is no longer usable.

**\[2 EP\] My Power, My Strength**
Whenever you deal damage to a target using a physical technique, you now use the Quirk Technique Damage table instead of the Physical Technique Damage table.

**\[2 EP\] Rivalry**
Whenever you are engaged in combat against a single target, any physical technique you employ deals an additional 2 damage for every letter rank that your Power is above an E rank.

**\[2 EP\] Rubber Body**
You now have advantage on defensive rolls against physical techniques and attacks that feature bludgeoning-based weapons or force. Additionally, whenever you take the Tank defensive action against a hit, and your roll exceeds the attacker's by 10 or more, then the attacker is dealt damage equal to your Spirit modifier. 

**\[2 EP\] Second Wind**
Whenever you would Quirk Exhaust as a result of Limit Bursting, you may evoke Second Wind to restore your Limit Pool to its maximum. You may not do this again until you have rested for at least 8 hours. 

**\[2 EP\] Spidey Senses**
While in an environment you have visited before, you can no longer be surprised. Additionally, you have advantage on defensive rolls against hidden enemies.

**\[2 EP\] Table Turn**
Once per combat, you may choose 1 hostile target that you can see (use your Control Rank to determine the range). That target's current health point total is revealed to you. If your currently have fewer health points than that target, you gain advantage on all defensive actions for the next 1d4 actions.

****
#questions: Should "Table Turn" say *turns* instead of *actions*?
****

**\[3 EP\] Akimbo**
Whenever you employ a physical technique or make an attack while wielding weapons in each hand, you may add the second weapon's freeform damage to the total dealt.

**\[3 EP\] Death Defying**
Whenever you are reduced to 0 health points, but the total damage you took is less than half of your health point maximum, you may evoke Death Defying in order to remain conscious and restore your health points to the amount equal to your Stamina modifier. You may not do so again until you have rested for at least 8 hours.

**\[3 EP\] Stone Gaze**
You have honed your will so intensely that you are able to paralyze others with just a look. When you evoke Stone Gaze, choose a single target that you can see (use your Control Rank to determine the range). That target must make an opposing Spirit Check against your own. If they fail, they lose 3 Action Points at the start of their next turn. You may use Stone Gaze a number of times equal to half your Spirit modifier rounded down. Your uses are restored after you have rested for at least 8 hours.

**\[3 EP\] Watch Out, Nerd!**
Whenever you employ an offensive Area of Effect technique or evoke an offensive enhancement that specifies both allies and enemies as targets, you may attempt to exclude your allies from its effects by rolling an unmodified d20. If the resulting value is higher than 10 plus the number of allies you're excluding, then all allies are safe from the effects of the technique or enhancement.
