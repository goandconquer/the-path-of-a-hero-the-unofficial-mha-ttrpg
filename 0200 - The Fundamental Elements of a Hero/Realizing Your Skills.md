## Skills

In *The Path of a Hero*, your character is defined by a set of core qualities that determine how capable they are at manifesting their heroic or villainous intentions into the world around them. These qualities, referred to as their **Skills**, are essential in shaping your journey from a budding hero (or villain) by describing your strengths and areas of growth. These Skills are Aptitude (APT), Spirit (SPR), Stamina (STA), Speed (SPD), Accuracy (ACC), and Power (PWR).

### Aptitude (APT)

**Aptitude** represents your character's natural talent and intelligence. It's a measure of problem-solving ability, strategic thinking, and the capacity to learn and adapt to new information and experiences. High aptitude characters excel in devising plans, realizing the crucial nuances to high-stress and complex situations, and utilizing their Quirks in creative ways.

### Spirit (SPR)

**Spirit** reflects your character's determination, courage, and willpower. Tied deeply to the energies of your Quirk, it's driving force behind their ability to overcome fear, resist control, stand unwavering against intimidation, see through deceptions, and persevere through insurmountable challenges. Characters with a strong Spirit are more resistant to psychological attacks and more easily navigate the social complexities brought on by the actions of the people around them. Spirit is essential for those who lead or aspire to be the moral compass of their team.

### Stamina (STA)

**Stamina** indicates your character's endurance, resilience, and overall health. It determines how much damage they can absorb before being overwhelmed, how long they can exert themselves, and their ability to recover from injuries or fatigue. High Stamina is vital for front-line fighters and those who serve as their as the shield for their fighters.

### Speed (SPD)

**Speed** measures your character's agility, reflexes, and overall quickness. It affects their ability to dodge attacks, react to sudden changes, and take initiative in combat.

### Accuracy (ACC)

**Accuracy** reflects your character's precision, focus, and timing. It's critical for landing attacks from a distance or against an elusive target. High Accuracy ensures that characters can take advantage of weaknesses in an opponent's form.

### Power (PWR)

**Power** denotes your character's raw physical strength and the intensity of their Quirk. It influences the damage they deal, the effectiveness of their physical and Quirk-based attacks, and their ability to overpower obstacles or enemies. Characters with immense Power are fearsome in direct confrontations.

## Quirk Focus

Every Quirk has a corresponding Skill that serves as the anchor for the abilities called a **Quirk Focus**. The nature of Quirk you created in ["Unlocking Your Quirk"](Unlocking%20Your%20Quirk.md) may naturally associate itself with a Skill, but you are allowed to make a case to the Gamemaster as to why any one of the Skills could be conceptually appropriate for your character's Quirk.

A Quirk Focus has special rules and use cases that provide active benefits to the character depending on the nature of their Quirk. More generally, a Quirk Focus becomes the default Skill to be used in most instances throughout the system, especially in performing Skill Checks (described later in ["Mastering Combat"](../0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement/Mastering%20Combat.md)) or activating Techniques (described later in ["Crafting Techniques"](../0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement/Crafting%20Techniques.md)).

## Experience

**Experience** is the quantifiable measure of your character's growth across the lifetime of the campaign. As your character engages with the world around them, they will gain a greater understanding of themselves, their capabilities, and their part to play in the grand scheme of things.

The Sensei is ultimately responsible for determining how often experience is awarded as well as how much each time, but there should be a consensus between everyone participating regarding the pacing of progression.

As a player, you decide how to distribute your awarded experience between your various Skills to raise your character's overall mastery over them. The next section explains how these investments pay off your character in the long run.

### Letter Ranks

**Letter Ranks** are alphabetical designations that represent the potency of, quality of, or mastery over some thing within the world. They are universal marker that apply to many aspects of the system, but, in the context of creating your character, they act as representations of your character's proficiency with the Skills that they rely on to act within the world.

Every letter rank has a base (A) that can be suffixed with either a minus (A-) or a plus (A+) to further indicate the degree of the rank. The variations available for a letter rank (A-, A, A+) is known as a **Letter Block**.

When you are first creating your character, all of their Skills are assigned a letter rank of D. Whenever the total experience you've invested into a particular Skill exceeds a threshold between degress within the same letter, as indicated in the table below, the modifier that you apply to Skill Checks made whenever your character attempts to carry out an Action that relies on that Skill increases. 

| Rank | -                 | =                 | +                 |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| E    | 10-19 (-4)        | 20-34 (-3)        | 35-54 (-2)        |
| D    | 55-84 (-1)        | 85-124 (+0)       | 125-174 (+1)      |
| C    | 175-239 (+2)      | 240-309 (+3)      | 310-389 (+4)      |
| B    | 390-489 (+5)      | 490-609 (+6)      | 610-749 (+7)      |
| A    | 750-919 (+8)      | 920-1,109 (+9)    | 1,110-1,329 (+10) |
| S    | 1,330-1,599 (+11) | 1,600-1,999 (+12) | 2,000+ (+13)      |

There are other considerations to share regarding the advancement of your character that will be relevant. The following sections go into more detail regarding your character's limitations and mechanics which enable your character to advance beyond them. 

### The Human Limit

Quirks carry a payload of overwhelming power and influence that easily lend themselves to the aesthetic of superhero culture, but those who wield them are still only human. New wielders often discover that they lack the physical resilience needed to match the taxing potency of their newfound abilities. While dedicated training and a precise lifestyle help bridge the gap between their physique and the demands of their quirk, a new problem soon emergesâ€”they reach the limit of growth their bodies can handle and begin to stagnate.

The **Human Limit** refers to the conceptual ceiling that all characters are subject to as a manifestation of the physical constraints they experience as human beings. The human limit is represented by a letter rank of C+.

This means that, as you invest experience into your character's skills, you are able to immediately gain the benefit of the modifier increase up to a letter rank of C+. Once at that point, your character is locked out of gaining the modifier increase for letter ranks beyond even though you may still invest experience into those skills.

### Limit Rank

The **Limit Rank** is an indication of how proficiently your character can utilize his or her Skills in keeping with their physical, emotional, and mental limitations.

Mechanically, the limit rank of a skill communicates the highest letter rank that your character mechanically benefits from in the form of a modifier applied when attempting to perform actions that rely on that skill. It does not reflect the highest letter rank reached from the investment of experience. 

At the start, the upper threshold for your character's highest achievable limit rank is the human limit (C+).

### True Rank

The **True Rank** is an indication of the potential advancement available to your character if they are were not subject to the limitations of their physical form.

The true rank of a skill can always be raised by investing experience into that skill, but it does result in an increase to the highest modifier available to your character whenever they attempt to perform actions that rely on that skill.

## Enhancement Points

**Enhancement Points** are a measure of your character's readiness to advance beyond their current limits or to specialize into domains of training that yield knowledge, tolerances, or abilities that further augment your character's role in the field and in academia.

The way to earn enhancement points is through investing enough experience into the true rank of a particular skill to cause it to advance to the next letter block (i.e. D+ to C). When this happens, you are awarded an enhancement point that can be spent on a skill amplification or to achieve a milestone within a particular heroic training domain.

### Skill Amplification

**Skill Amplification** is the term that refers to investing an enhancement point into a particular skill in order to benefit from the access to the modifiers available within the next letter block.

You may freely invest experience into a skill without performing a skill amplification, but you will not benefit from the increased modifiers provided by the letter ranks within that letter block. Still, it is a useful sacrifice since you can apply those enhancements gained from advancing between letter blocks elsewhere (for example, you might purposefully invest in a skill you don't use as frequently during play in order to earn an enhancement point that you might invest in another skill you more frequently so its stronger).

### Skill Switching



### Control Rank

The true ranks of your character's skills act as the basis for calculating your character's Control Rank.

You determine the Control Rank of a character by dividing the sum of all of the Experience that your character has accumulated by 5 and comparing the result against the table of Letter Ranks above.
## Health Points

**Health Points** represents the amount of fatigue and injury that your character can endure before succumbing to them and falling unconscious. It is calculated as the sum of the modifiers of all your character's skills except Stamina, plus the amount of additional hit points as determined by the rank of your character's Stamina modifier according to the following table:

| Rank | -   | =   | +   |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| E    | 9   | 10  | 11  |
| D    | 14  | 17  | 20  |
| C    | 25  | 30  | 35  |
| B    | 42  | 49  | 56  |
| A    | 67  | 78  | 99  |
| S    | 111 | 123 | 135 |

Your character's total hit points can be further increased through the use of the armors, items, and techniques, (discussed in detail in the third chapter, [The Rules of Engagement](../0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement/0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement.md)).
## Technique Points

**Technique Points (TPs)** are representative of your character's ability to discover and master techniques throughout their career. Every technique that your character learns costs a certain number of technique points depending on the technique's rank and type.

When you create a technique for your character, following the rules and guidelines listed in [Crafting Techniques](../0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement/Crafting%20Techniques.md), you allocate the number of technique points for that technique as specified by the following table. Unless otherwise stated in the technique type's description, all techniques follow this table. 

| Technique Rank | Technique Cost (in TPs) |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| D              | 1                       |
| C              | 2                       |
| B              | 3                       |
| A              | 4                       |
| S              | 5                       |

The number of technique points that your character has available to spend is determined by their Control Rank, as shown in the following table.

| Control Rank | Technique Points |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| D            | 5                |
| C            | 8                |
| B            | 12               |
| A            | 17               |
| S            | 23               |

You may not create new techniques or increase the rank of existing techniques if you do not have the sufficient technique points to do so.
## Limit Points

**Limit Points (LPs)** are representative of the physical, mental, and emotional toll that your character must bear in order to activate and utilize techniques that they have learned.

This subject is discussed in more detail in the [Harnessing the Limit Pool](../0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement/Harnessing%20the%20Limit%20Pool.md) section of the [0300 - Rules of Engagement](../0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement/0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement.md) chapter, specifically regarding topics such as the Limit Refresh Rate, the Limit Point cost of activating techniques, and concepts such as Limit Bursting and Quirk Exhaustion.

For the purposes of character creation, the most relevant information is in relation to the size of your character's **Limit Pool**. 

The Limit Pool refers to the number of Limit Points available to your character when they are at their most rested. The size of your character's Limit Pool is also determined by your character's Control Rank, according to the following table.

| Control Rank | Limit Pool |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| D            | 6          |
| C            | 9          |
| B            | 13         |
| A            | 18         |
| S            | 24         |

## Plus Ultra Points

**Plus Ultra Points** are a special resource available to valiant heroes or nefarious villains, earned exclusively by award from the Gamemaster for intriguing, compelling, creative, or exciting behavior during play or as a result of rolling a Natural when the value is 20.

These represent the pinnacle of a hero or villain's resolve to carry out their ambitions in the world, often fueled by their intimate relationship with their Quirk. At key moments, these characters may align with or manifest their true potential in the world, and are empowered to do even more because of it.
