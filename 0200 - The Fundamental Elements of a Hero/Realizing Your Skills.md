## Skills

In *The Path of a Hero*, your character is defined by a set of core qualities that determine how capable they are at manifesting their heroic or villainous intentions into the world around them. These qualities, referred to as their **Skills**, are essential in shaping your journey from a budding hero (or villain) by describing your strengths and areas of growth. These Skills are Aptitude (APT), Spirit (SPR), Stamina (STA), Speed (SPD), Accuracy (ACC), and Power (PWR).

**Aptitude** represents your character's natural talent and intelligence. It's a measure of problem-solving ability, strategic thinking, and the capacity to learn and adapt to new information and experiences. High aptitude characters excel in devising plans, realizing the crucial nuances to high-stress and complex situations, and utilizing their Quirks in creative ways.

**Spirit** reflects your character's determination, courage, and willpower. Tied deeply to the energies of your Quirk, it's driving force behind their ability to overcome fear, resist control, stand unwavering against intimidation, see through deceptions, and persevere through insurmountable challenges. Characters with a strong Spirit are more resistant to psychological attacks and more easily navigate the social complexities brought on by the actions of the people around them. Spirit is essential for those who lead or aspire to be the moral compass of their team.

**Stamina** indicates your character's endurance, resilience, and overall health. It determines how much damage they can absorb before being overwhelmed, how long they can exert themselves, and their ability to recover from injuries or fatigue. High Stamina is vital for front-line fighters and those who serve as their as the shield for their fighters.

**Speed** measures your character's agility, reflexes, and overall quickness. It affects their ability to dodge attacks, react to sudden changes, and take initiative in combat.

**Accuracy** reflects your character's precision, focus, and timing. It's critical for landing attacks from a distance or against an elusive target. High Accuracy ensures that characters can take advantage of weaknesses in an opponent's form.

**Power** denotes your character's raw physical strength and the intensity of their Quirk. It influences the damage they deal, the effectiveness of their physical and Quirk-based attacks, and their ability to overpower obstacles or enemies. Characters with immense Power are fearsome in direct confrontations.

### Quirk Focus

Every Quirk has a corresponding Skill that serves as the anchor for the abilities called a **Quirk Focus**. The nature of Quirk you created in ["Unlocking Your Quirk"](Unlocking%20Your%20Quirk.md) may naturally associate itself with a Skill, but you are allowed to make a case to the Gamemaster as to why any one of the Skills could be conceptually appropriate for your character's Quirk.

A Quirk Focus has special rules and use cases that provide active benefits to the character depending on the nature of their Quirk. More generally, a Quirk Focus becomes the default Skill to be used in most instances throughout the system, especially in performing Skill Checks (described later in ["Mastering Combat"](../0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement/Mastering%20Combat.md)) or activating Techniques (described later in ["Crafting Techniques"](../0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement/Crafting%20Techniques.md)).  
## Experience

They say that experience is the greatest teacher, and this is no more true than for the lucky (or, perhaps, unlucky) minority who find themselves thrust into the terrific world of quirks. As your character engages with the world around them, they will gain a greater understanding of themselves, their capabilities, and the world around them. This growth is quantified in the system as **Experience**.

Experience is a special resource awarded to characters throughout the lifetime of the campaign which can be allocated to their skills in order to raise their overall power. The Gamemaster determines the amount of experience awarded as well as the frequency at which it is awarded, though it is typically given out on a session-by-session basis.

The act of allocating any amount of your character's accumulated Experience into a particular skill is known as **investing in a skill**. You may decide on how to distribute your accumulated Experience, but the sum of the investments made into each of your character's skills cannot exceed the amount of Experience they have accumulated over the lifetime of the campaign.
### Letter Ranks

**Letter Ranks** are alphabetical designations used to describe the potency of, quality of, or one's mastery over some thing within the world. Each base letter rank (A) can be suffixed with a minus (A-) or plus (A+) to further specify the degree of the property it is communicating.

In terms of creating your character, letter ranks are representative of their proficiency with the Skills that they rely on to act in the world.  

As you invest your character's accumulated Experience into each of your character's skills, they cross thresholds of growth as determined by the following table.

| Rank | -                 | =                 | +                 |
| ---- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| E    | 10-19 (-4)        | 20-34 (-3)        | 35-54 (-2)        |
| D    | 55-84 (-1)        | 85-124 (+0)       | 125-174 (+1)      |
| C    | 175-239 (+2)      | 240-309 (+3)      | 310-389 (+4)      |
| B    | 390-489 (+5)      | 490-609 (+6)      | 610-749 (+7)      |
| A    | 750-919 (+8)      | 920-1,109 (+9)    | 1,110-1,329 (+10) |
| S    | 1,330-1,599 (+11) | 1,600-1,999 (+12) | 2,000+ (+13)      |

The letter rank of a skill determines the **Modifier** which is added to rolls made using skills.

### The Human Limit

Quirks carry a payload of overwhelming power and influence that easily lend themselves to the aesthetic of superhero culture, but those who wield them are still only human. New wielders often discover that they lack the physical resilience needed to match the taxing potency of their newfound abilities. While dedicated training and a precise lifestyle help bridge the gap between their physique and the demands of their quirk, a new problem soon emergesâ€”they reach the limit of growth their bodies can handle and begin to stagnate.

The **Human Limit** refers to the conceptual ceiling that all characters are subject to as a manifestation of the physical constraints they experience as human beings, represented by a letter rank of C+.

This letter rank indicates the upper limit of your character's skills. Once a skill has been brought up to this limit, any further investment of experience does not result in an increase of the skill's modifier. This means that each skill can be represented by two separate letter ranks.
### Limit Rank

The **Limit Rank** is an indication of how proficiently your character can utilize his or her Skills in keeping with their physical, emotional, and mental limitations.

For most characters, the upper threshold for their Limit Rank is the Human Limit (C+), but this can be raised through the investment of an Enhancement Point.

### True Rank

The **True Rank** of a skill describes the what the letter rank of the skill would be if your character was not subject to the limitations of their physical form. This rank can always be raised by investing in it, but it is not the rank that determines the modifier applied to rolls.


if the resulting letter rank is higher than the corresponding limit rank of the skill. Instead, each time that the true rank of a skill is raised by a full letter rank (i.e. E => D), your character gains an **Enhancement Point**.
## Enhancement Points

**Enhancement Points** refer to your character's ability to raise the threshold of benefit they receive from their mastery in certain skills, or to specialize in interests and domains that further augments your character's roles in the field and in academia which yields them knowledge, tolerances, or abilities not otherwise learned.

Enhancement Points are earned through the raising of a skill's letter rank to the next whole letter (i.e. E to D, D to C, etc.). Each time this occurs, you are awarded a single enhancement point to spend on either **Skill Amplification**, or on milestones in **Heroic Trainings** (described in detail in the next section).

It is not an immediate requirement for a character who has earned an enhancement point through the leveling of a skill's letter ran to spend it on *Skill Amplification*.
### Skill Amplification

### Skill Switching

### Control Rank


The true ranks of your character's skills act as the basis for calculating your character's Control Rank.

You determine the Control Rank of a character by dividing the sum of all of the Experience that your character has accumulated by 5 and comparing the result against the table of Letter Ranks above.
## Health Points

**Health Points** represents the amount of fatigue and injury that your character can endure before succumbing to them and falling unconscious. It is calculated as the sum of the modifiers of all your character's skills except Stamina, plus the amount of additional hit points as determined by the rank of your character's Stamina modifier according to the following table:

| Rank | -   | =   | +   |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| E    | 9   | 10  | 11  |
| D    | 14  | 17  | 20  |
| C    | 25  | 30  | 35  |
| B    | 42  | 49  | 56  |
| A    | 67  | 78  | 99  |
| S    | 111 | 123 | 135 |

Your character's total hit points can be further increased through the use of the armors, items, and techniques, (discussed in detail in the third chapter, [The Rules of Engagement](../0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement/0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement.md)).
## Technique Points

**Technique Points (TPs)** are representative of your character's ability to discover and master techniques throughout their career. Every technique that your character learns costs a certain number of technique points depending on the technique's rank and type.

When you create a technique for your character, following the rules and guidelines listed in [Crafting Techniques](../0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement/Crafting%20Techniques.md), you allocate the number of technique points for that technique as specified by the following table. Unless otherwise stated in the technique type's description, all techniques follow this table. 

| Technique Rank | Technique Cost (in TPs) |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| D              | 1                       |
| C              | 2                       |
| B              | 3                       |
| A              | 4                       |
| S              | 5                       |

The number of technique points that your character has available to spend is determined by their Control Rank, as shown in the following table.

| Control Rank | Technique Points |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| D            | 5                |
| C            | 8                |
| B            | 12               |
| A            | 17               |
| S            | 23               |

You may not create new techniques or increase the rank of existing techniques if you do not have the sufficient technique points to do so.
## Limit Points

**Limit Points (LPs)** are representative of the physical, mental, and emotional toll that your character must bear in order to activate and utilize techniques that they have learned.

This subject is discussed in more detail in the [Harnessing the Limit Pool](../0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement/Harnessing%20the%20Limit%20Pool.md) section of the [0300 - Rules of Engagement](../0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement/0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement.md) chapter, specifically regarding topics such as the Limit Refresh Rate, the Limit Point cost of activating techniques, and concepts such as Limit Bursting and Quirk Exhaustion.

For the purposes of character creation, the most relevant information is in relation to the size of your character's **Limit Pool**. 

The Limit Pool refers to the number of Limit Points available to your character when they are at their most rested. The size of your character's Limit Pool is also determined by your character's Control Rank, according to the following table.

| Control Rank | Limit Pool |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| D            | 6          |
| C            | 9          |
| B            | 13         |
| A            | 18         |
| S            | 24         |

## Plus Ultra Points

**Plus Ultra Points** are a special resource available to valiant heroes or nefarious villains, earned exclusively by award from the Gamemaster for intriguing, compelling, creative, or exciting behavior during play or as a result of rolling a Natural when the value is 20.

These represent the pinnacle of a hero or villain's resolve to carry out their ambitions in the world, often fueled by their intimate relationship with their Quirk. At key moments, these characters may align with or manifest their true potential in the world, and are empowered to do even more because of it.
