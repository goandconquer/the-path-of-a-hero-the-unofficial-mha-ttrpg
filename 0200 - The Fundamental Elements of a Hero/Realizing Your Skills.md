## Skill Attributes

## Experience

As characters engages and integrates themselves with the world around them, they will gain a greater understanding of themselves and their abilities. In the system, this growth is quantified by an incrementing numerical value called Experience.

Experience is typically awarded in small increments to characters on a session-by-session basis, at the discretion of the Gamemaster. The cumulative sum of these increments comprise the total amount of experience that a character has accumulated. This total may then be allocated, per the player's preference, to the various skills that comprise the strengths of their character. Information on skills is located under "Determining Your Skills."

As players accrue and allocate experience throughout their time in participating in sessions, the impact of their experience is represented by markers of growth denoted by letters. These are called Ranks. Each named rank may serve a specific mechanical purpose but ultimately they all similarly denote a level of articulated power. 
### Letter Ranks

### The Human Limit

### True Rank

### Limit Rank

### Control Rank

You determine the Control Rank of a character by dividing the sum of all of the Experience that your character has accumulated by 5 and comparing the result against the table of Letter Ranks above. 
## Plus Ultra Points

**Plus Ultra Points** are a special resource available to valiant heroes or nefarious villains, earned exclusively by award from the Gamemaster for intriguing, compelling, creative, or exciting behavior during play or as a result of rolling a Natural when the value is 20.

These represent the pinnacle of a hero or villain's resolve to carry out their ambitions in the world, often fueled by their intimate relationship with their Quirk. At key moments, these characters may align with or manifest their true potential in the world, and are empowered to do even more because of it.
## Technique Points

## Enhancement Points

It is not an immediate requirement for a character who has earned an enhancement point through the leveling of a skill's letter ran to spend it on *Skill Amplification*.

## Health Points
