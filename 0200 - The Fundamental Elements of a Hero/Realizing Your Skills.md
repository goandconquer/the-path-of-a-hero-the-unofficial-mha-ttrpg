## Skills

In *The Path of a Hero*, your character is defined by a set of core qualities that determine  how capable they are at manifesting their heroic or villainous intentions into the world around them. These qualities, referred to as their **Skills**, are essential in shaping your journey from a budding hero (or villain) by describing your strengths and areas of growth. 

- **Aptitude** represents your character's natural talent and intelligence. It's a measure of problem-solving ability, strategic thinking, and the capacity to learn and adapt to new information and experiences. High aptitude characters excel in devising plans, realizing the crucial nuances to high-stress and complex situations, and utilizing their Quirks in creative ways.

- **Spirit** reflects your character's determination, courage, and willpower. Tied deeply to the energies of your Quirk, it's driving force behind their ability to overcome fear, resist control, stand unwavering against intimidation, see through deceptions, and persevere through insurmountable challenges. Characters with a strong Spirit are more resistant to psychological attacks and more easily navigate the social complexities brought on by the actions of the people around them. Spirit is essential for those who lead or aspire to be the moral compass of their team.

- **Stamina** indicates your character's endurance, resilience, and overall health. It determines how much damage they can absorb before being overwhelmed, how long they can exert themselves, and their ability to recover from injuries or fatigue. High Stamina is vital for front-line fighters and those who serve as their as the shield for their fighters.

- **Speed** measures your character's agility, reflexes, and overall quickness. It affects their ability to dodge attacks, react to sudden changes, and take initiative in combat.

- **Accuracy** reflects your character's precision, focus, and timing. It's critical for landing attacks from a distance or against an elusive target. High Accuracy ensures that characters can take advantage of weaknesses in an opponent's form.

- **Power** denotes your character's raw physical strength and the intensity of their Quirk. It influences the damage they deal, the effectiveness of their physical and Quirk-based attacks, and their ability to overpower obstacles or enemies. Characters with immense Power are fearsome in direct confrontations.
### Quirk Focus

Every Quirk has a corresponding Skill that serves as the anchor for the abilities called a **Quirk Focus**. The nature of Quirk you created in ["Unlocking Your Quirk"](Unlocking%20Your%20Quirk.md) may naturally associate itself with a Skill, but you are allowed to make a case to the Gamemaster as to why any one of the Skills could be conceptually appropriate for your character's Quirk.

A Quirk Focus has special rules and use cases that provide active benefits to the character depending on the nature of their Quirk. More generally, a Quirk Focus becomes the default Skill to be used in most instances throughout the system, especially in performing Skill Checks (described later in ["Mastering Combat"](../0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement/Mastering%20Combat.md)) or activating Techniques (described later in ["Crafting Techniques"](../0300%20-%20The%20Rules%20of%20Engagement/Crafting%20Techniques.md)).  
## Experience

As your character engages and integrates themselves with the world around them, they will gain a greater understanding of themselves and their abilities through their knowledge gained during their time as a student, and the experience provided to them through their mentor and later adventures as a professional hero (or villain). This growth is quantified by a numerical value called **Experience**.

Experience is typically awarded in small increments to your character on a session-by-session basis at the discretion of the Gamemaster. The cumulative sum of these increments comprise the total amount of experience that a character has accumulated, which determines your character's Control Rank described later in this chapter.

Any portion of the total Experience accumulated by your character can be distributed between the Skills to amplify their proficiencies in actions related to that skill, but the sum of the Experience invested into each Skill cannot exceed your total accumulated Experience.
### Letter Ranks

**Letter Ranks** are alphabetical designations assigned to each of your character's Skills to describes your character's mastery with that skill. Each designation can be further suffixed with a minus to represent a lower proficiency in that Rank or with a plus sign to describe higher proficiency.

As you invest earned Experience into each of your character's Skills, your mastery in that Skill increases as you cross over thresholds of growth, as determined by the following table.

| Minus | Letter Rank | Plus |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| E- \| 10 to 19 \| -4 | E \| 20 to 34 \| -3 | E+ \| 35 to 54 \| -2 |
| D- \| 55 to 84 \| -1 | D \| 85 to 124 \| +0 | D+ \| 125 to 174 \| +1 |
| C- \| 175 to 239 \| +2 | C \| 240 to 309 \| +3 | C+ \| 310 to 389 \| +4 |
| B- \| 390 to 489  \| +5 | B \| 490 to 609 \| +6 | B+ \| 610 to 749 \| +7 |
| A- \| 750 to 919 \| +8 | A \| 920 to 1,109 \| +9 | A+ \| 1,110 to 1,329 \| +10 |
| S- \| 1,330 to 1,599 \| +11 | S \| 1,600 to 1,999 \| +12 | S+ \| 2,000+ \| +13 |
The numerical value at the end of each entry is the table is the **Modifier** that is applied to appropriate Skill Checks and other applicable rolls.
### The Human Limit

### True Rank

### Limit Rank

### Control Rank

You determine the Control Rank of a character by dividing the sum of all of the Experience that your character has accumulated by 5 and comparing the result against the table of Letter Ranks above. 
## Plus Ultra Points

**Plus Ultra Points** are a special resource available to valiant heroes or nefarious villains, earned exclusively by award from the Gamemaster for intriguing, compelling, creative, or exciting behavior during play or as a result of rolling a Natural when the value is 20.

These represent the pinnacle of a hero or villain's resolve to carry out their ambitions in the world, often fueled by their intimate relationship with their Quirk. At key moments, these characters may align with or manifest their true potential in the world, and are empowered to do even more because of it.
## Technique Points

## Enhancement Points

It is not an immediate requirement for a character who has earned an enhancement point through the leveling of a skill's letter ran to spend it on *Skill Amplification*.
