# [[0200a004 - Understanding Letter Ranks]]

## Understanding Experience

As characters engages and integrates themselves with the world around them, they will gain a greater understanding of themselves and their abilities. In the system, this growth is quantified by an incrementing numerical value called Experience.

Experience is typically awarded in small increments to characters on a session-by-session basis, at the discretion of the Gamemaster. The cumulative sum of these increments comprise the total amount of experience that a character has accumulated. This total may then be allocated, per the player's preference, to the various skills that comprise the strengths of their character. Information on skills is located under "Determining Your Skills."

As players acrue and allocate experience throughout their time in participating in sessions, the impact of their experience is represented by markers of growth denoted by letters. These are called Ranks. Each named rank may serve a specific mechanical purpose but ultimately they all similarly denote a level of articulated power.
