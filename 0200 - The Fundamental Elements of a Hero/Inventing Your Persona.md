## Backgrounds

> "If you feel yourself hitting up against your limit, remember for what cause you clench your fists. Remember why you started down this path, and let that memory carry you beyond your limit."
> 
> All Might, *My Hero Academia*

While the powers and responsibilities granted by the Quirks are the defining focus in My Hero Academia, there is no greater indicator that a Quirk wielder can change their world than their relationship with their past. Some may find themselves soaring into the world of danger and adventure, while others may struggle to reconcile with their newfound powers. 

As a player, the first major decision that you can make for your character is his or her background. Backgrounds lay the foundation for how their personality, motivations, morality, and goals align with the momentum of the ever-changing world they reside in. Does the harshness of your character's childhood lead to them seeing their powers as a means to exact revenge on a society that saw them as expendable? Does a thoughtful upbringing lead your character to seek to uphold the virtues of the heroic culture, even when it's inconvenient?

It's important to remember that the Background of your character is just the beginning. A good Background should enable your character to have room to grow and develop beyond their origins, but their upbringing and early experiences should always be a part of who they are.

Consider how their lineage, environments, and philosophies could contribute to their future ambitions and actions. Backgrounds that provide enough malleable creative material that is both challenging and inspiring are often the strongest, as they can continually enhance a hero's (or villain's) journey throughout the lifetime of the campaign.

The following Backgrounds serve as starting points for your brainstorming. They are not intended to be followed strictly as they are written, rather you should be adding and removing as much as you see fit as you design the character you want to play.
### Ex-Delinquent

You have been in and out of trouble with the law throughout your life. You have a certain amount of "street cred" and may or may not have a few contacts in the underworld. You are more of an anti-hero and looked down upon by the hero community, but you get some dirtier jobs done that others cannot.

### Projects Kid

You come from a lesser income family and have lived with less all your life. You understand the worth of money and know where some villains are coming from, having a similar background to many low-level thugs. Despite your lack of affluence, hard work, and hard work, and perseverance has gotten you closer to your dreams and the money you always lacked as a child.

### Heroic Parents

You come from parents who either make more money than average or have parents who are active heroes in the community and have an above average income due to that. With this type of lifestyle, you will have more responsibility put onto your shoulders. You see becoming a hero and beginning a legacy as the best way to honor your family.

A character with the Heroic Parents background receives 5d4 * 60 starting Quin.
### Legendary Heroic Lineage

You are simply the newest member in a long line of heroes, members of your family are extremely high-ranking heroes or very wealthy. This puts an extremely heavy burden on you to become every bit as impressive as those before you. The way that you have decided to do this is through heroism.

A character with the Legendary Hero Lineage background receives 5d4 * 80 starting Quin.
### Villainous Heritage

You have become a ward of the state due to the actions of one or more of your parents or ancestors. The government has done their best to hide this background to allow you a normal life. Despite their best efforts, a combination of Quirk inheritance, as well as information leaks, makes it difficult for you to remain out of the public eye. You plan to overcome this by proving to everyone that you can be a better hero than anyone.

## Psyches

Psyches refer to the profile of enduring characteristics and behavior that guides your character as they are influenced by and respond to the conceptual and narrative elements of the world they live in, especially through their thoughts, words, and actions. Your character's Psyche can be defined as simply as the primary emotions that your character defaults to when faced with opposition, or as thoroughly as the tenants of morality that your character abides by, the extent to which they expect the world to honor those tenants, and what it would take for them to break those tenants.

Psyches are the most abstract element of the character creation process, as the decisions may seemingly come across as impulsive or without a clear reason why a particular notion of the character's personality is right or wrong. However, their conception can provide insight into the other major choices associated with the character creation process, especially in regards to the kind of Quirk that manifests within them (if they have one).

When determining the Psyche of your character, you should consider what virtues are represented most strongly by your character. Is your character more imaginative or insightful? Is your character multi-faceted, naturally gifted, or a slow learner? How curious are they? How fearful are they? Do they value knowledge over experiences? Do they value control? Are they patient and thoughtful, able to sense out the hidden dangers around them, or are they ambitious to a fault? Are they fiercely independent, or are they easily led astray? Are they socialites or loners? Are they enduring in trust and kindness, or are they paranoid of being betrayed? Are they blossoming allies or bitter rivals? Are they self-sacrificing or manipulative? Are they resilient or easily overwhelmed?

All these questions impact how your character will face the world and how the world will face them.
### Aspirations

A character with no goals have no reason to be a character. In a setting writhe with competition and uncertainty, your character will want to define certain targets that generally motivate them to faces the dangers of today.

An Aspiration is any articulated desire that can only be obtained through the diligent action of the character who desires it. Aspirations may be quite personal to the character, or rather be a larger public ambition that requires the collective efforts of other people or even other organizations. Aspirations may be secretive and jeopardize either the safety or the acceptance of the character, or be issues that should see the light of public scrutiny. In any case, the character's Aspirations should intrinsically possess obstacles not yet able to be overcome, whether due to a lack of experience, authority, or resources. It is not necessary that these all be long term goals, although a good Aspiration is one that can evolve and color moments throughout an entire narrative arc.

As you determine who your character is as a person, you should consider how your Aspirations might unite or divide others around you. You should consider what sacrifices might be required of your character, and whether they are yet in a place to fully realize the extent of them. Aspirations that drive a character forward throughout their journey while remaining an open question about commitment can create rewarding drama to explore throughout roleplay.
