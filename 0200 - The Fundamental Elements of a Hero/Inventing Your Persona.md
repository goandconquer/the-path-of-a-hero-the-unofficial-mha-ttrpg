## Backgrounds

> "If you feel yourself hitting up against your limit, remember for what cause you clench your fists.... Remember why you started down this path, and let that memory carry you beyond your limit. "
> 
> All Might, *My Hero Academia*

While the powers and responsibilities granted by the Quirks are the defining focus in My Hero Academia, there is no greater indicator that a Quirk wielder can change their world than their relationship with their past. Some may find themselves soaring into the world of danger and adventure, while others may struggle to reconcile with their newfound powers. 

As a player, the first major decision that you can make for your character is his or her background. Backgrounds lay the foundation for how their personality, motivations, morality, and goals align with the momentum of the ever-changing world they reside in. Does the harshness of your character's childhood lead to them seeing their powers as a means to exact revenge on a society that saw them as expendable? Does a thoughtful upbringing lead your character to seek to uphold the virtues of the heroic culture, even when it's inconvenient?

It's important to remember that the Background of your character is just the beginning. A good Background should enable your character to have room to grow and develop beyond their origins, but their upbringing and early experiences should always be a part of who they are.

With this in mind, choose wisely when determining your character's backstory. Consider how their lineage, environments, and philosophies could contribute to their future ambitions and actions. Backgrounds that provide enough malleable creative material that is both challenging and inspiring are often the strongest, as they can continually enhance a hero's (or villain's) journey throughout the lifetime of the campaign.

The following Backgrounds serve as starting points for your brainstorming. They are not intended to be followed strictly as they are written, rather you should be adding and removing as much as you see fit as you design the character you want to play.

### Ex-Delinquent

You have been in and out of trouble with the law throughout your life. You have a certain amount of "street cred" and may or may not have a few contacts in the underworld. You are more of an anti-hero and looked down upon by the hero community, but you get some dirtier jobs done that others cannot.

### Projects Kid

You come from a lesser income family and have lived with less all your life. You understand the worth of money and know where some villains are coming from, having a similar background to many low-level thugs. Despite your lack of affluence, hard work, and hard work, and perseverance has gotten you closer to your dreams and the money you always lacked as a child.

### Heroic Parents

You come from parents who either make more money than average or have parents who are active heroes in the community and have an above average income due to that. With this type of lifestyle, you will have more responsibility put onto your shoulders. You see becoming a hero and beginning a legacy as the best way to honor your family.

### Legendary Heroic Lineage

You are simply the newest member in a long line of heroes, members of your family are extremely high-ranking heroes or very wealthy. This puts an extremely heavy burden on you to become every bit as impressive as those before you. The way that you have decided to do this is through heroism.

A character with the Legendary Hero Lineage background receives 5d4 * 80 starting Quin.

### Villainous Heritage

You have become a ward of the state due to the actions of one or more of your parents or ancestors. The government has done their best to hide this background to allow you a normal life. Despite their best efforts, a combination of Quirk inheritance, as well as information leaks, makes it difficult for you to remain out of the public eye. You plan to overcome this by proving to everyone that you can be a better hero than anyone.

## Psyches

Psyches refer to the profile of enduring characteristics and behavior that guides your character as they are influenced by and respond to the conceptual and narrative elements of the world they live in, especially through their thoughts, words, and actions. Your character's Psyche can be defined as simply as the primary emotions that your character defaults to when faced with opposition, or as thoroughly as the tenants of morality that your character abides by, the extent to which they expect the world to honor those tenants, and what it would take for them to break those tenants.

Psyches are the most abstract element of the character creation process, as the decisions may seemingly come across as impulsive or without a clear reason why a particular notion of the character's personality is right or wrong.

For a player that requires more guidance in understanding the Psyche of their character,  the "Big Five" model can offer some more insight. Each trait is described below.

**Openness**

Openness describes how imaginative and insightful a character might be, how likely they are to develop interest in more than one subject or activity, how curious they are about the world, and how eager they are to partake in activities that grant them more knowledge or new experiences. Those who are lower in openness may experience anxiety when deviating from what they are familiar with and purposefully avoid situations with more ambiguity to maintain their sense of control.

**Conscientiousness**

Conscientiousness refers to the thoughtfulness, willpower, and ambition of a character. Highly conscientious characters will be more organized, attentive to details, and often are strategists and leaders. Characters with lower conscientiousness often do not have as many guiding systems and are more easily led astray by outside influences.

**Extraversion**

Extraversion deals with how excitable and outgoing a character is, as well as how expressive they are with their emotions. Highly extraverted characters are often more likely to contend with other characters, perhaps even regardless of their appearance, beliefs, alignment, or regardless of the danger they pose. Characters lower in extraversion might rely on others to do the talking and may have a harder time finding their place in large gatherings.

**Agreeableness**

Agreeableness relates how trusting, altruistic, diplomatic, or affectionate a character may be when interacting with others. Highly agreeable characters often become fierce supporters of the party as well as heralds of morale. Those character that are lower in agreeableness may exhibit more competitive or manipulative tendencies.

**Neuroticism**

Neuroticism is the degree to which a character experiences negative emotions and general instability in their response to the world around them. Highly neurotic characters struggle with anxiety, sadness, irritability, or distancing. Those characters low in neuroticism are more stable and emotionally resilient.
