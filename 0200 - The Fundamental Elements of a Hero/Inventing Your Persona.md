# Backgrounds

Quirks are the defining feature of My Hero Academia, granting individuals powers that can drastically alter their lives. These abilities can lead them down paths they never could have imagined, for better or for worse. Some may find themselves thrust into a world of danger and adventure, while others may struggle to control their newfound powers.

As a player, your character's background is crucial in shaping their journey. It sets the foundation for their personality, motivations, and goals. The choices you make during character creation will have a significant impact on your character's story and how they interact with the world around them.

It's important to remember that your character's background is just the beginning. They should have room to grow and develop beyond their origins, but their upbringing and experiences will always be a part of who they are. With this in mind, choose wisely when crafting your character's backstory. Consider their family, environment, and personal history, and think about how these factors have shaped them into the hero or villain they are today.

## Ex-Delinquent

You have been in and out of trouble with the law throughout your life. You have a certain amount of "street cred" and may or may not have a few contacts in the underworld. You are more of an anti-hero and looked down upon by the hero community, but you get some dirtier jobs done that others cannot.

## Projects Kid

You understand the worth of money and know where some villains are coming from, having a similar background to many low-level thugs. Despite your lack of affluence, hard work, and hard work, and perseverance has gotten you closer to your dreams and the money you always lacked as a child.

## Heroic Parents

You come from parents who either make more money than average or have parents who are active heroes in the community and have an above average income due to that. With this type of lifestyle, you will have more responsibility put onto your shoulders. You see becoming a hero and beginning a legacy as the best way to honor your family.

## Legendary Heroic Lineage

You are simply the newest member in a long line of heroes, members of your family are extremely high-ranking heroes or very wealthy. This puts an extremely heavy burden on you to become every bit as impressive as those before you. The way that you have decided to do this is through heroism.

## Villainous Heritage

You have become a ward of the state due to the actions of one or more of your parents or ancestors. The government has done their best to hide this background to allow you a normal life. Despite their best efforts, a combination of Quirk inheritance, as well as information leaks, makes it difficult for you to remain out of the public eye. You plan to overcome this by proving to everyone that you can be a better hero than anyone.
