# Unlocking Your Quirk

Heroes come in all shapes and sizes, and that's not an exaggeration. With so many superhumans scattered throughout society, figuring out what it means to be a human has become quite the challenge.

Many have strived to use their newfound abilities to protect those who cannot protect themselves, aspiring for society and their peers to recognize them as heroes. Others have opted to exploit their superiority over those who see them as freaks and give into their own selfish desires, becoming villains.

Regardless of the motivation, all of them rely on the manifestation of a unique source of supernatural power—the Quirk.

## What is Your Quirk

The manifestation of a Quirk can encompass an infinite range of characteristics and functions, however everyone possess three key traits.

- The characteristics and functions of the Quirk has some reasonable basis, given suspension of disbelief, in scientific knowledge.
- The Quirk possesses certain drawbacks that impact the physical, emotional, or intellectual health of its user.
- The manifestation of the Quirk should be distinctive and signicantly separate from other Quirks. That is to say, the core theme of the Quirk may be the same as another, but their specific characteristics and functions must differ.

## The Three Quirk Types

Since the discovery of the first manifested Quirk, significant efforts have been made to analyze and catagorize the common characteristics and functions of superhuman abilities. However, the range of potential manifestions is near infinite and thus the effort to understand and group them is never-ending and the system constantly adapts to new Quirks.

Although most Quirks could be reasonably grouped into multiple catagories, most Quirks will primarily fall into one of three broad types based on their function. These types are labeled as _Emiter_, _Mutation_, and _Transformation_.

### Emitter Quirks

Emitter Quirks are denoted by their ability to release certain substances or emit a certain aura. They often require a conscious effort to activate and sometimes require large amounts of concentration for them to remain active. They are accompanied by a subtle physical mutation or deformity.

Unlike other Quirks, an Emitter Quirk possesses an inherent enhancing aspect that bolsters the overall effectiveness of a character's techniques through an additional die that is rolled whenever that character evokes a Trained Technique. The strength of this die is determined by the character's Quirk Tier, according to the following table.

| Quirk Tier | Buff/Debuff |
|------------|-------------|
| Tier 4     | +0          |
| Tier 3     | +d4         |
| Tier 2     | +d6         |
| Tier 1     | +d8         | 
| Tier 0     | +d10        |

### Transformation Quirks

Often, the manifestation of a person's quirk is so deeply tied to their biological or physiological state that they cannot be decoupled. This often enables a person with a Transformation Quirk to temporarily embody alterations that usually enhance existing features, remove features, or adding new features.

These Quirks often carry with them a number of physical buffs as they relate to the theme of a character's Transformation Quirk. These buffs help better define the conceptual characteristics of their active transformation state, although they typically last only a short period time before the character inevitably experiences a Quirk Exhaust.

Transformation Quirks do not utilize the regular Quirk Tier system. Instead, you gain a bonus modifier to a number of skills based on your Quirk Tier as shown in the table below. It is an uncontestable requirement that one of these chosen skills be your character's Quirk Focus. If Stamina is raised this way, the character gains HP while concentrating on their active transformation state.

| Tier Rank | # of "True Rank" Stats    |
| --------- |---------------------------|
| Tier 4    | 1                         |
| Tier 3    | 2                         |
| Tier 2    | 3                         |
| Tier 1    | 4                         |
| Tier 0    | 5                         |

Characters with a Transformation Quirk do not have to spend Enhancement Points to raise their True Rank above the Human Limit like other Quirk types. The trade-off is that their Limit Rank cannot ever raise past a C+ (or the Human Limit) via this process.

For starting characters, it is likely that their True Rank will be lower than their Limit Rank of C+. In these situations, when the character concentrates on their active transformation state, their True Rank modifiers will be temporarily replaced by the Limit Rank modifiers because they are higher. This exchange is only true while the character is concentrating on their active transformation state.

When a character is able to inevitably raise their True Rank above the Human Limit, a permanent conceptual exchange takes place. Their True Rank modifiers now only apply while they are concentrating on their active transformation state and their Limit Rank apply otherwise.

The alterations gained from concentrating on a character's Transformation Quirk last only as long as they have the energy (or Limit Points) and do not suffer some physical, mental, or spiritual Status Effects that would otherwise interrupt their concentration. While a character concentrates on their active transformation state, they must spend a number of Limit Points equal to the modifier determined by their Control Rank or be forced to release their concentration.

### Mutation Quirks

Quirks of this type dramatically alter the underlying architecture of a person, however their existance still manifests in the form of a noticable external feature. Mutation Quirks are active all the time due to their significant integration into a person's physiology. They are also seen as a minority in the social hierarchy of superhumans and are often discriminated against. These alterations can also singificantly impact how these characters live day-to-day. They often require custom equipment to accomodate external features or special materials to cope with sensitivities.

Mutation Quirks gain an array of flat bonuses that can be assigned to a character's stats based on their Quirk Tier, according to the following table:

| Tier Rank | Bonus to Stat(s) |
|-----------|------------------|
| Tier 4    | +0               |
| Tier 3    | +1               |
| Tier 2    | +2, +1           |
| Tier 1    | +3, +2, +1       |
| Tier 0    | +4, +3, +2, +1   |

### Possessing Multiple Quirks

## The Quirk Tiers

Although the manifestation of a Quirk in a person is a truly miraculous event, not all Quirks possess the same level of power. A character could develop a relatively weak Quirk like that of Mineta or Uraraka or a strong Quirk like Bakugou or Todoroki.

Quirk Tiers are effectively loose estimates of an individual's power and the limits of these Quirks are constantly tested and often evolve through a process know as Quirk Awakening. Some characters in the world have achieved incomprehensible levels of power that few have been able to imitate. Because of the rarity of this situation, characters who have done this are said to possess a Quirk Tier of 0.

However, the Quirk Tier of a character's Quirk can be inferred from a number of behaviors and mannerisms while that Quirk is in use. The tiers and a description of their power are as follows:
- Tier 4 — Quirks of this tier could be limited to just wiggling your fingers or floating small objects to yourself. Characters have limited control of their Quirk or have little standing in the superhuman community, to the point that they are often labeled as "Quirkless" as they are rarely beneficial in dangerous situations.
- Tier 3 — Quirks of this tier are considered to be of reasonable power and may include abilities such as making things float or growing sticky balls out of your head. This is the most common tier and can have more of an impact on people who see them, even if they are not extremely awe-inspiring. Quirks often require a geat deal of time to control and refine to live up to the standard of the heroic community.
- Tier 2 — Quirks of this tier have a large range of uses and can be used over a larger area. They are usually quite powerful, but require training and time to master. Most of the heroes that actively patrol the streets have Quirks of this tier.
- Tier 1 — Quirks of this tier are not only naturally powerful but also have incredible range and versatility. They are much harder to refine and master. Within the superhuman community, they are seen as amazing and useful.
- Tier 0 — Quirks of this tier possess near-infinite potential and power. They often disregard limitations and can significantly alter reality, however the amount of training and time is equally infinite. Villains and professional heroes will likely have one or two Quirk wielders of this rank.

At the time of their creation, a hero's Quirk Tier is typically determined by a single roll of a d20, where the generated value maps to the following table:

| Value of 1d20 | Quirk Tier |
|---------------|------------|
| 1-2           | Tier 4     |
| 3-14          | Tier 3     |
| 15-19         | Tier 2     |
| 20            | Tier 1     | 
| N/A           | Tier 0     |

Once a hero's Quirk Tier has been set in this way, the only way to advance it is through a process known as Quirk Awakening.

## Quirk Awakening

The process of moving between tiers is known as Quirk Awakening and offers superhumans the ability to add to their array of abilities and increase the potency of their Quirk.

Characters are able to advance to higher tiers through dedication, persistance, and sacrifice—however, the moment at which evolution occurs is when the character is at their most exhausted. In order to achieve the conditions needed for a successful Quirk Awakening, a character must experience a Limit Burst while under 5 HP and spend a number of Plus Ultra Points according to the Quirk Tier they are transitioning to, according to the following table:

| Tier Rank Transition | Plus Ultra Point Cost |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Tier 4-3             | 05 PUPs               |
| Tier 3-2             | 10 PUPs               |
| Tier 2-1             | 15 PUPs               |
| Tier 1-0             | 20 PUPs               |
